      <description>NOTE: I have an update on my progress as of 9/1/2015 here
Motivated by my good friend CheerUpLove.com&amp;rsquo;s reflective style of blogging, and Ian Forrester&amp;rsquo;s many interesting posts, I thought it would be interesting to post something a bit more personal and less technical on this blog.
Now that 2015 is upon us, I am going to take some time to publicly outline my goals for the year, so I can hold myself more accountable to them, and so I can look back on them this time next year.</description>
