      <description>For 8 TB of data storage on Google Drive, plus my own Google organization, I am paying Â£30/month, which is a pretty good deal.
I wanted to use this space for backing up my NAS, but it was proving difficult. The program I was recommended for Linux backup, Duplicati, was not the best for this purpose. My backup runs would not complete, they would be slow, and full of syncing errors.</description>

      <description>I wanted to get a Kindlefire HDX running under Ubuntu 12.04 with adb.
First I needed to setup the udev rules:
1. Edit /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules as root, and add the following line (create this file if it does not exist):
SUBSYSTEM==&amp;#34;usb&amp;#34;, ATTRS{idVendor}==&amp;#34;1949&amp;#34;, MODE=&amp;#34;0666&amp;#34; 2. Change the permission of this file by executing the following command as root:
chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules 3. Reload the rules by executing the following command as root:</description>

      <description>Linux command-line editors such as nano and vim often, by default, create backup files with the prefix of &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;. I.e, if I created a file called /home/david/myfile, then nano would create a backup in /home/david/myfile. Sometimes it doesn&amp;rsquo;t delete them either, so you&amp;rsquo;re left with a bunch of backup files all over the place, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re editing a lot on a directory tree full of source code.
Those stray backup files make directory listings confusing, and also add unnecessary weight to the commits on source control systems such as svn, cvs, git.</description>
