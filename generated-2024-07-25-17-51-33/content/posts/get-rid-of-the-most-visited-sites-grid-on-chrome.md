title: Get rid of the 'most visited sites' Grid on Chrome

Not that I particularly look at anything weird, but when I'm showing someone my computer I don't want to have my 'most visited sites' pop up when I fire up Chrome. The following Chrome extension will get rid of the default loading page, and just display a blank page:

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/empty-new-tab-page/dpjamkmjmigaoobjbekmfgabipmfilij](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/empty-new-tab-page/dpjamkmjmigaoobjbekmfgabipmfilij)
