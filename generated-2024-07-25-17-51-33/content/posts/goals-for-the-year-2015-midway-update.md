Now that I am midway through the year, I thought I'd revisit [the goals I set myself at the start of the year](http://www.davidcraddock.net/?p=1301&preview=true), to see what has changed.

### Career Goals

- _Settle into my new role at the BBC as Test Manager_ \- I suppose this has not been achieved. I will have more updates soon (hopefully) but a change of direction is likely to happen.
- _Pushing for a place to be opened up in Platform Test to employ someone from the Extend Scheme_ \- This has been achieved, and someone will be joining Platform Test from the Extend scheme in October, I'm happy to say.

### Creative Goals

- _Get better at music production_ \- This has been achieved. I have been working with my friend I will call 'G', which has massively improved my production skills. I have posted music that I see as much better to Soundcloud.

### Social Goals

- _Getting married_ \- Well.. things didn't work out with that. But I have a new girlfriend who will hopefully be moving to live with me, so things seem to be recovering there.
- _Making friends with more people that share the same interests_ \- Partly achieved. G is a good example of someone that I have met through looking for friends with the same interest.

### Financial Goals

- _Saving more over the course of the year_ \- Partly achieved. I have bought a house, so now I am in a quite a bit of debt, but the money I will be putting towards my mortgage will be money I am effectively 'saving' because it will be put into the value of the house.
- _Joining a pension scheme_ \- Achieved.

### Health Goals

- _Adopt a regular form of keeping fit_ \- Not achieved. I have a gym even closer to where I live, 5 minutes walk, so hopefully I will use it more soon. It is difficult for me, as the medication I'm on makes me feel tired all the time, but they do say that exercise improves energy levels.

### Conclusion

Although I've achieved the majority of my goals, I haven't achieved two of the major goals - around my job and around exercise, which are both things I need to work on. There is still time left this year to make a difference in these areas.
