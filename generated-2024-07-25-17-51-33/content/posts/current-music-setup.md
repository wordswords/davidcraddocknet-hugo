I like to dabble in making and playing music. Here is the equipment and setup that I use.

**Ableton Live Intro**

This is the DAW I use. I have been using Ableton Live for several years now, and I know my way around it. I have tried others but they never really felt as comfortable. [Live comes in three flavours](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/feature-comparison/), 'Intro' is the most basic paid-for version. I was surprised how cheap the 'Intro' version was, and how little I find myself needing the features of the more expensive versions. I only have one paid-for VST plugin, and that is the KORG Legacy Cell MS-20, which I use on almost all the music I've made.

**KORG Electribe R-1 MK2 Analog Modelling Drum Synthesiser**

This is what serves as my drum machine. I picked it up on the cheap, but I'm really happy with it. I really like the built in step sequencer, and the drum synth itself. The sounds you can make from it are quite varied, and I really like the way you can put together live compositions on the fly. I'd be interested in getting some more KORG boxes, such as the [EMX Electribes](http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov03/articles/korgemx1.htm) or the Volcas.

This is my analogue synthesiser, which I use mainly for leads. In practice I find it quite annoying not being able to play real chords, and the lack of a sequencer is difficult because it means I can't put together patterns away from the PC, or even really play it without a keyboard. I do like the sound, and the filter is great. The 'fake chords' option is great fun I just wish you could more easily change between the chords on the fly. The arp is pretty cool also. I think this will become a lot more awesome when I get a hardware sequencer, I already have my eye on the cheap [BeatStep](http://www.arturia.com/evolution/en/products/BeatStep/intro.html) to pick up when it is released.

I don't really use this for anything, unfortunately. It was my first synthesiser and although I liked it at the time, nowadays I find the lack of MIDI and the ribbon keyboard a major problem. I might either sell it or get a MIDI mod and install it. I find it quite noisey when recording anyway, so maybe I'll just try and sell it. It does has some nice acid style sounds though. A shame.

[![monotribe](/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/monotribe.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/monotribe.jpg)**Yamaha P35 Digital Piano**

I was looking for a decent MIDI out keyboard that would allow me to put together more complex melodies and learn how to play keyboards for possibly joining a band in the future. The Yamaha NP31, which was my original choice, was out of stock and so it got me looking at others. I thought it would be interesting to learn to play the piano, as we had one growing up but I never really learned before. In the store I really liked the feel of the P35's hammer action keys, so decided to buy it. I can play some simple tunes with it but want to get piano lessons so I can improve. This will also function as my main MIDI controller for my other hardware.

This is a nice little keyboard controller that I use with Ableton. Unfortunately it does not have MIDI out, only MIDI via USB, but I can run it through the MIDISport to control audio hardware. The keyboard action is very nice, much better than the M-Audio Keystation 49 which I had before and would not recommend.

[![controller](/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/controller.jpeg)](/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/controller.jpeg)**M-Audio MIDISport Anniversary Edition 2x2 MIDI/USB Interface**

This is a [fairly standard cheap MIDI to USB interface](http://www.amazon.co.uk/M-Audio-Midisport-2x2-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B001D5D454/). I used to use the M-Audio Uno, but that has only one input/output and it has problems with some audio hardware.
