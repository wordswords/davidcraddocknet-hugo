I've started my own blog consulting business, helping people setup their own blogs, either for their company or for personal use. It's called [The Blog Factory](http://www.BlogFactory.co.uk), see the site for more information on what we do. In a nutshell, we can:

1) Setup and customise WordPress blogs.
2) Design custom WordPress themes.
3) Develop tailored WordPress plugins.
4) Host the blogs on our servers.
5) Use our SEO expertise to improve traffic to the blog.
