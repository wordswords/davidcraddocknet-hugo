title: Craiglist opens a Brighton, UK section

I just noticed that US bulletinboard giant Craigslist.com has opened [a Brighton UK section](http://brighton.craigslist.org/) of their website! There are a few posts already. At the moment, [Gumtree's Brighton Section](http://brighton.gumtree.com) is massively popular here. I've recurited several flatmates using Gumtree, and am basing my local housing search around it.

It will be interesting to see how Gumtree.com fares now that Craigslist.com has competition in the Brighton local area.
