title: Things I'd like to Learn More About

Some things I have been meaning to investigate in my own time, but haven't, because life just gets in the way.

1. Maths
 \- It might surprise a few people that, as a software developer, I never took maths to A-level. I picked up a bit of maths in my CS degree, but I never really got a firm grounding in it. This has prevented me from understanding and coding advanced stuff in game development, understanding audio to a decent level, and generally doing things in which I consider the more interesting fields of computing.
2. Music Theory
 \- I have been getting better at playing the piano/keyboard by ear, but I have never fully learned to read music, and I would like to.
3. Electronics
 \- I would love to be able to build simple DIY synthesiser module kits for my Eurorack setup. I imagine I'd have to start on something small though.

It would be great if I could take courses in these subjects, via the OU or something similar. I just have to find the time.
