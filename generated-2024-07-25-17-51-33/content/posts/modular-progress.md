Specs

I have finished filling the top half of my Eurorack case, see above. Here is a list of modules:

- [Dual VCA - A-132-3](http://www.doepfer.de/a1323.htm)
- [Buffered Multiples - Intellij Buff Mult](http://www.intellijel.com/eurorack-modules/buff-mult/)
- [VCO #1 - A-110-1 VCO](http://www.doepfer.de/a110.htm)
- [VCO #2 - A-110-1 VCO](http://www.doepfer.de/a110.htm)
- [Low Pass Filter - A-120](http://www.doepfer.de/a120.htm)
- [Multiples #1 - A-180-1](http://www.doepfer.de/a180.htm)
- [Multiples #2 - A-180-1](http://www.doepfer.de/a180.htm)
- [Quantizer - A-156 Dual Quantizer](http://www.doepfer.de/a156.htm)
- [Envelope Generator - A-140 ADSR](http://www.doepfer.de/a140.htm)
- [Noise Generator/Random - A-118](http://www.doepfer.de/a118.htm)
- [Quad LFO - A-143-3 Quad LFO](http://www.doepfer.de/a1433.htm)

Next Moves:

- Get a logarithmic mixer module [A-138b](http://www.doepfer.de/a138.htm) for mixing the output of the noise + two VCOs into the filter, and to free up some of my ZED-10 mixer channels for other things
- Got another [A-140](http://www.doepfer.de/a140.htm) ADSR module but no cable, going to get a cable and put it into the bottom left corner of the lower section.

Usage

My (mostly) Doepfer Eurorack is hooked up to my Microbrute, 2x Doepfer Dark Energy MK1s and my ZED-10 recording mixer.

The Microbrute acts as a pitch and gate out keyboard controller for all the synths and a semi-modular synthesiser in its own right with its patchbay.

The Doepfer Dark Energys are complete synth voices with a fair amount of input/outputs for modulation. They are hooked up to the pitch and gate out from the Microbrute via the Buff Mult and the Multiples on the Eurorack.

One configuration that I often use when composing music, is wire the Eurorack, the Dark Energys and the Microbrute into the ZED-10 mixer, tune each so they all play together, and create one massive analogue 5-osc synth mono voice which is great for devastating basslines, and I can modulate with the LFOs and envelopes in the system. I can then program a sequence into the Microbrute and transpose it when I play notes down on the Microbrute keyboard, or control it via the USB IN from Ableton.

Another configuration which I find interesting is patching the output of the Noise Generator/Random through the Quantizer. This results in random musical notes played by the oscilator, and you can create interesting pattern or arpeggios created solely by the Euroack without human input. I like the idea of generative music, and will be buying more modules to create more interesting computer generated randomness and music.
