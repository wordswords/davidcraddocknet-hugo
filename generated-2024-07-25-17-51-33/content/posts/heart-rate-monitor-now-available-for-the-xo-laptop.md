Volunteers on the [OLPC project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child) have developed a low-cost heart rate monitor that can be plugged into the [XO laptop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO-1), making steps towards an affordable monitoring system for hospitals in developing countries.

For more information on the development, see the: [OLPC Goldenstate](http://olpcgoldenstate.blogspot.com/2009/04/new-pcb-revision-and-low-cost-proto.html) project. People in the US can currently buy the [sensor here](http://xoexplosion.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1_34&products_id=158); unfortunately there is no international shipping yet in place.
