I passed the adExcellence exam first time.. woo! It wasn't that difficult really.

"David Craddock of [iCrossing](http://www.icrossing.co.uk/what-we-do/paid-search/) is accredited as an official Microsoft adExcellence Member. A Microsoft adExcellence Member has completed comprehensive online training on managing Microsoft adCenter search engine marketing campaigns and has demonstrated expert knowledge by passing the Microsoft adExcellence accreditation exam."

As of 21/3/08, I'm somehow also now #1 on Google.co.uk for the keyword "adExcellence exam".. if that's what you googled for, you probably want the [adExcellence](http://www.adexcellence.com) main site instead. Or use Live Search.
