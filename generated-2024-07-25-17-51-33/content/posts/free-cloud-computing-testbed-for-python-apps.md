This is so cool.. Google are beta-testing a totally free hosting and cloud-computing resource called Google App Engine. The caveat is that your hosted app must be written in Python. Python is amazing anyway, and if you don't know it, now is the perfect time to learn. Check this out for more information about Google App Engine:

They're giving away a very generous 500MB disk space and enough processing power to serve 5 million pages a month. Awesome!
