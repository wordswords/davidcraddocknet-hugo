This is my work from home setup. I work from home every work day. I use the following equipment:

### Linux Workstation 'study.local'

- Ivy Bridge 8 Processor Xeon (16 cores total)
- 256GB SSD system drive running Kali Linux rolling
- 1TB moving platter drive
- 32GB DDR3 RAM
- 10Gbit/sec fibreoptic network card
- IBM Lenovo ThinkStation C30 Case and PSU
- Benq 32" 2560x1440 graphic designers monitor on Amazon Basics extendable desk mount arm

### Equipment shared between the laptops of the companies I work for, and my own workstation

- Logitech 5.1 surround sound system with 5 speakers and subwoofer
- Sony WH-1000XM3 Apt-X HD Noise cancelling headphones with an Avantree Oasis Plus Apt-X HD bluetooth transmitter, so I can listen to any of the music devices on noise cancelling headphones
- Logi USB headset with noise cancelling microphone
- Anker vertical mouse
- Kinesis Freestyle 2 ergonomic keyboard
- Apple Magic Pad 2 that I've made work with Ubuntu - I use this in preference to the vertical mouse as I've found it much more comfortable in most cases.
- Logitech Key light for web cam calls
- LogiTech C920 web cam

### Other Equipment

- HDMI, network cables, KVM and and USB hookups for 2 additional laptops if needed
