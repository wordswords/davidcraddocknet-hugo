- Honeywell desk fan
- Logitech 5.1 surround sound system with 5 speakers and subwoofer
- Sony WH-1000XM3 Apt-X HD Noise cancelling headphones with an Avantree Oasis Plus Apt-X HD bluetooth transmitter, so I can listen to any of the music devices on noise cancelling headphones

- IKEA MARKKUS chair with the armrests removed as they are not adjustable and therefore not ergonomic
