## Clothes and Gear

A good set of cycling clothes is essential for comfortable all-weather all-year cycling, even in an area with a relatively 'mild' climate such as Manchester.

* Fingerless MTB gloves for warmer weather
* Wraparound anti-glare sun glasses for protection against surface dirt etc
* Wraparound cycle goggles with different visors
* Goretex water-resistant high-vis cycle jacket
* Light backpack suitable for cycling
* Thermal 'long johns'
* Rockbros Heated rechargable motorbike style gloves
* 2x pairs of rechargable heated glove batteries
* 2x heated glove battery chargers
* Shorts with seat padding
* Leg and arm warmers
* Rockbros rechargable e-bike helmet with built-in (powerful) LED front light with up and down action so not to blind drivers, and rear light

## Security

* 2x LiteLock X1 Angle-grinder Resistant Bike Locks (Diamond Motorbike Solid Secure Rated)
* 2x Sheffield Bike stands set in concrete in my garden
* 2x Oxford ground anchors set in concrete in my garden (Diamond Motorbike Solid Secure Rated)
* 1x Oxford giant chain and padlock (Gold Motorbike Solid Secure Rated / Diamond Bicycle Solid Secure Rated)
* CycleRegister security marking kits for both bikes
* Immobilise security marking kit and RFID tags for both bikes
* Insurance. Lots of insurance.

## Training

* I have achieved 'Bikeability Level 3' as an adult, verified in December 2024, which is the most widely accepted form of road-ready cycle training and certification. [Link here](https://www.bikeability.org.uk/). Level 3 focuses in cycling safely in heavy traffic. This qualifies me to hire Electric Cargo Bikes.
* I have studied books and Driving Theory test material to learn how to navigate roads and read road signs, approximately to the level of a driving theory test, although I don't officially hold a driving licence.
