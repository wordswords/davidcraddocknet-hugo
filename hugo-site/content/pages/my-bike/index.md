- Wraparound anti-glare sun glasses for protection against surface dirt etc
- Wraparound cycle goggles with different visors

- Thermal 'long johns'
- Heated rechargable motorbike style gloves
- Shorts with seat padding
- Leg and arm warmers
- Rockbros rechargable e-bike helmet helmet with built-in (powerful) LED front light with up and down action so not to blind drivers, and rear light
