I am currently familiarising myself with tools to do security research around physical pentesting.

This is in preparation for my research project as part of the MSc Cyber Security masters I'm taking from the University of London via distance learning.

This research is strictly for informational purposes and I don't do anything criminal with it.

## Wardriving and Wifi cracking

I have two Raspberry Pi Zeros configured headless with pwnagotchi

## Password cracking

I have a hashmat password cracker setup that utilises my PC with an Nvidea gaming graphics card.

## M5StickC2 running Nemo

I have a M5StickC2 running [https://github.com/n0xa/m5stick-nemo](Nemo firmware) which replicates most of the interesting functionality of the Flipper Zero at a tiny fraction of the price.

I can use it to deauth wifi APs and run captive wifi APs, as well as wifi spam and some pranks around bluetooth and infrared hacking.

## RFID and Smart Card Security

I have a Proxmark3 setup which I'm using to learn about smart card security and smart card cloning. I am still getting used to using this, there is a lot to learn!

## Kali Nethunter

I am planning on installing Kali Nethunter on my old Sony Xperia 1 III. This will allow me to do more security research on the go.

## Self-hosting Security

I am moving to self-host as much of my digital content as possible, to force myself how to learn to secure things properly.

* As a web server I'm currently using 'SWAG' - [https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/swag](Secure Web Application Gateway), which includes fail2ban, ngnix, certbot and letsencrypt in a secure configuration.
* I use [https://relay.firefox.com/accounts/profile/](Firefox Relay) to provide an anonymous email alias for countering spam.
* I use [https://www.cloudflare.com](CloudFlare) heavily for DDOS protection and a lot of other features for my self-hosted domains.
