# Security Research

I am currently familiarising myself with tools to do security research around physical pentesting.

This is in preparation for my research project as part of the MSc Cyber Security masters I'm taking from the University of London via distance learning.

This research is strictly for informational purposes and I don't do anything criminal with it.

## Wardriving and Wifi cracking

I have two Raspberry Pi Zero 2s configured headless with pwnagotchi

## Passord cracking

I have a hashmat password cracker setup that utilises my PC with an Nvidea gaming graphics card.

## Evil Wifi AP

I have a small device which I can use as an evil wifi portal. This will deauth a WAP, change its SSID name to that WAP, and capture information from those devices connecting to it.

## RFID and Smart Card Security

I have a Proxmark3 setup which I'm using to learn about smart card security and smart card cloning. I am still getting used to using this, there is a lot to learn!

## Kali Nethunter

I am planning on installing Kali Nethunter on my Sony Xperia 1 III. This will allow me to do more security research on the go.
