I've always liked writing and have been doing it for a long time.


### Poetry

#### 'Snowflakes'

```
Silence is a different mind
In crowds with noise and shouts
and people
who never knew what they might find
if still with thought, they stopped
and wondered.

Does your mind have hidden stairs?
With words to climb, and towers present
If you noticed, let me know,
for words are almost too
like whispers.

In dancing, do you leave yourself?
And go towards, another person
Things in beauty are flights in freedom
And nothing's true if all's forgotten.
```

#### 'Avalanche'

```
Beneath the twin peaks, you were born.
on a crisp morning when everything was white.

I never knew you as a child.
Leaping over rocks and playing on the fields.

Silently you grew, and many did not see it
until you were strong, and pure, and racing.

The valleys deep, they never knew your name
as you muttered them softness and brought them blankets.

The trees did not stop you, they couldn't, they wouldn't.
You washed them over, and took them with you.

Falling like a blizzard on a bright summer morning,
you tripped, then stumbled, and fell all around us.

You never thought what damage you caused
until you were still and silent, as now. And over.
```

#### 'Benefit Cheat'

```
The truth of the matter is: I didn't read the terms.
I didn't stop for a second, I had other concerns.
The truth of the matter is: I never knew her name.
It wasn't important to me; they read all the same.

The truth of the matter is: She wasn't very well.
How long did she suffer for? Well, who can tell?
The truth of the matter is: You reap what you sow.
And if you're poor in this society, then to work you should go.

The truth of the matter is: I don't know how she died.
But she could have worked, and she shouldn't have lied.
The truth of the matter is: everyone is treated the same.
And if it's not fair on you, then it's not me to blame.

I never was there, I never knew how
this lack of guilt would catch me somehow
and here I am now in this cold empty room
this noose right in front of me
(which we'll get to soon)
It wasn't me who sentenced all these people to death
(his lack of concern shows to his last breath)

but I never did anything
this is not meant to be
you can't prove anything
NO! SOMEBODY HELP ME!
```

#### 'Ultava by Smetana'

```
Stream
Slowly Trickling,
Creeping along,
The river is born.

Storm
Grim clouds
Lightning strikes
Thunder rolling
Rain pouring, gushing.

Fort
Huge gate
Proud turrets
Dark and dank moat
Grimancing through rain.

End
Dead calm
Sea in sight
A sense of joy . . .

The river is free!
