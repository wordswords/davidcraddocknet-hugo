"vWorkbench" is my own personal Vim9-based development environment and writing environment that I'm trying to 'spin out' into an open source project that is stable enough, reusable enough and well-documented enough to be used by others.

<a href="https://github.com/wordswords/dotfiles.git">https://github.com/wordswords/dotfiles.git</a> - this is the current version on my development environment that I use as much as possible in both personal and work situations.

<a href="https://github.com/wordswords/dotfiles/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/wordswords/dotfiles/blob/master/README.md</a> - this is the documentation on my development environment, which I absolutely try and keep up to date.

<a href="https://github.com/wordswords/dotfiles/issues">https://github.com/wordswords/dotfiles/issues</a> - these are the issues that I've identified as 'blockers' to preventing me open-sourcing the project and opening it up to a wider audience.

FAQ:

1. Why not Neovim?
- Answer: I have considered using Neovim as a base and do not want to make the shift over at this time. In the future at some point that may change.
