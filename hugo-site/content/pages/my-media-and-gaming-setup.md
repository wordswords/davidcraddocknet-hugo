## My Games Consoles

I have a Kaico Edition OSSC Open Source Scan Converter 1.6, which upscales all my retro consoles to HDMI. I use cables from [https://retrogamingcables.co.uk/](https://retrogamingcables.co.uk/) with the OSSC, which are highly recommended as they make so much difference in terms of audio and video noise. The right cable can also unlock better sound and graphics quality when combined with the OSSC that was never available before.

I also have a Marsellie MClassic HDMI to HDMI hardware-based AI image improver and upscaler which I use for the output of the OSSC.

Currently these are the consoles I have hooked up:

- **Super Nintendo** with 2x official controllers
- **Sega Megadrive II** with 2x official 3 button controllers, and 2x official 6 button controllers
- **Sony PS2** with 2x official PS2 controllers, and 1 x official PS1 controller
- **Sony PS3** with 1x official PS3 controller
- **Sony PS4** with 1x official PS4 controller
- **Nintendo Gamecube** with 2x official Gamecube controllers
- **XBox 360** with 2x official wired 360 controllers
- **Sega Dreamcast** with 3x official DC controllers, 2x VMUs and 1x third-party memory pack
- **Sony PSP2000** (TV out)
- **Nintendo Wii (Gamecube compatiable version)** with 2x Wiimote Motion controller and official balance board
- **Nintendo 64 with 2x official N64 controller, Kaico PAL N64 -> HDMI convertor, expansion pak and memory pak**

### Portable Games Consoles

- I have a customised Sony PSP which I have cracked, and put a 64GB memory card in it. It has a complete set of SNES and Genesis games, as well as several PS One games which the PSP can emulate. I love playing the game 'Wip3out' on it.
- I have a Nintendo DSi XL which has a cartridge loader meaning I can play any games on it. Currently I mostly only use it for chess games, but aim to use it more.
- I have a Gameboy Advance SP which I use almost exclusively for the game 'Final Fantasy Tactics'.

## My Games

## Living Room TV Setup

We have a super minimal setup in our living room which my wife uses heavily. It is super minimal because she doesn't like overcomplicated tech stuff :) It consists of:

- Sony BRAVIA 2023 Edition, KD-43X75WL, 43 Inch, LED, Smart TV, 4K HDR, Google TV

Because it has Google TV, we can use the Plex app to wirelessly stream 4K videos from my Plex server, and it handles 4K videos well, which is not a small feat as the wireless signal is being blasted through a concrete wall :) Netflix and all the other standard services also work well.
