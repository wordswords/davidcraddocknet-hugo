## My Retro Games Consoles

I have a [Kaico Edition OSSC Open Source Scan Converter 1.6](https://kaicolabs.com/product/kaico-edition-open-source-scan-converter-ossc/), which upscales all my retro consoles to HDMI. I use cables from [https://retrogamingcables.co.uk/](https://retrogamingcables.co.uk/) with the OSSC, which are highly recommended as they make so much difference in terms of audio and video noise. The right cable can also unlock better sound and graphics quality when combined with the OSSC than was ever available before.

I also have a [Marsellie MClassic](https://marseilleinc.com/products/buy-mclassic) HDMI to HDMI hardware-based AI image improver and upscaler which I use for the output of the OSSC.

Currently these are the consoles I have hooked up:

- **Super Nintendo** with 2x official controllers
- **Sega Megadrive II** with 2x official 3 button controllers, and 2x official 6 button controllers
- **Sony PS2** with 2x official PS2 controllers, and 1 x official PS1 controller
- **Sony PS3** with 1x official PS3 controller
- **Sony PS4** with 1x official PS4 controller
- **Nintendo Gamecube** with 2x official Gamecube controllers
- **XBox 360** with 2x official wired 360 controllers and 360 Kinect
- **Sega Dreamcast** with 3x official DC controllers, 2x VMUs and 1x third-party memory pack
- **Sony PSP2000** (TV out)
- **Nintendo Wii (Gamecube compatiable version)** with 2x Wiimote Motion controller and official balance board
- **Nintendo 64 with 2x official N64 controller, Kaico PAL N64 -> HDMI convertor, expansion pak and memory pak**
- **Microsoft XBox V1** with 2x Duke controllers
- **SNK Mini Neo Geo** with 2x official controllers, and mini HDMI to HDMI cable for monitor output

### Portable Retro Games Consoles

- Sony PSP which I have cracked, and put a 64GB memory card in it. It has a complete set of SNES and Genesis games, as well as several PS One games which the PSP can emulate. I love playing the game 'Wip3out' on it.
- Nintendo DSi XL which has a cartridge loader meaning I can play any games on it. Currently I mostly only use it for chess games, but aim to use it more.
- Gameboy Advance SP which I use almost exclusively for the game 'Final Fantasy Tactics'. I also have 4x cables to connect GBAs to the Nintendo Gamecube for multiplayer games that used this functionality, and a headphone adaptor for the GBA SP.
- Original Gameboy which I use with Tetris.

## My PC and Console Games

I collect physical and digital games, both modern and retro. You should able to browse through the games I have, both on PC and console, here: [https://wordswords.github.io/media-library-homepage](https://wordswords.github.io/media-library-homepage)

As of October 2024, these are my Playnite statistics for paid games owned across all PC launchers:

![image](gamelibrarystats.png)

I also have an install of [ExoDos](https://www.retro-exo.com/exodos.html) and [ExoWin31](https://www.retro-exo.com/win3x.html) on my media PC, which allows me to play any game ever released on DOS and Windows 3.1.

## Living Room TV Setup

We have a separate minimal setup in our living room which my wife uses heavily. It is minimal because she doesn't like overcomplicated tech stuff :) It consists of:

- Sony BRAVIA 2023 Edition, KD-43X75WL, 43 Inch, LED, Smart TV, 4K HDR, Google TV

Because it has Google TV, we can use the Plex app to wirelessly stream 4K videos from my Plex server, and it handles 4K videos well, which is not a small feat as the wireless signal is being blasted through a concrete wall :) Netflix and all the other standard services also work well.
