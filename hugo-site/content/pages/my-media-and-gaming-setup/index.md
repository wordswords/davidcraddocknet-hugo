### My PC Gaming Controllers

#### Joypads

These all work with the gaming PC and laptop and connect via USB:

* XBox Elite V2 White Controller
* XBox Elite V1 Black Controller

#### Retro Digital Joystick

#### HOTAS

I have two Flight Sticks and a throttle. The dual Flight Stick setup is useful for Mechwarrior style games, although I usually use the Flight Stick + Throttle for most games. They are installed on quick-release Hikig desk mounts so they can be easily setup and removed when not in use, to save space.

* 2x Thrustmaster T16000M Flight Stick
* Thrustmaster TWCS Throttle
* 3x Hikig HOTAS Mount

#### Arcade Setup

This is located on a 'pedestal' in front of the TV. It consists of the 2 Arcade sticks and 2 lightguns and a wireless keyboard and mouse.

It is connected via the gaming computer via a 4 port USB 2.0 extender over Cat6 cable, with a 10 meter Cat6 cable, so that I can play arcade games on my pedestal without lots of wires.

* Logitech Wireless keyboard and mouse (third keyboard and mouse used for operating when at the arcade pedestal)

##### Retro Games Consoles

I have a [Kaico Edition OSSC Open Source Scan Converter 1.6](https://kaicolabs.com/product/kaico-edition-open-source-scan-converter-ossc/), which upscales all my retro consoles to HDMI. I use cables from [https://retrogamingcables.co.uk/](https://retrogamingcables.co.uk/) with the OSSC, which are highly recommended as they make so much difference in terms of audio and video noise. The right cable can also unlock better sound and graphics quality when combined with the OSSC than was ever available before.

I also have a [Marsellie MClassic](https://marseilleinc.com/products/buy-mclassic) HDMI to HDMI hardware-based AI image improver and upscaler which I use for the output of the OSSC.

Currently these are the consoles I have hooked up. They are all 'PAL' unless otherwise specified:

* **Super Nintendo** with 2x official controllers and NTSC and J-NTSC cartridge converter
* **Sega Megadrive II (region unlocked)** with 2x official 3 button controllers, 2x official 6 button controllers and Master System cartridge converter

* **Microsoft XBox Original** with 2x Duke controllers
* **SNK Mini Neo Geo International** with 2x official controllers, and mini HDMI to HDMI cable for monitor output (audio output via HDMI)
* **Nintendo NES Mini** with 2x controllers

##### Portable Retro Games Consoles

* **Sony PS Vita OLED 1st Gen** with cracked firmware and a 64GB memory card, allowing it to play any game from the store.
* **Sony PSP** which I have cracked, and put a 64GB memory card in it. It has a complete set of SNES and Genesis games, as well as several PS One games which the PSP can emulate. I love playing the game 'Wip3out' on it.
* **Nintendo DSi XL** which has a cartridge loader meaning I can play any games on it. Currently I mostly only use it for chess games, but aim to use it more.
* **Gameboy Advance SP** which I use almost exclusively for the game 'Final Fantasy Tactics'. I also have 4x cables to connect GBAs to the Nintendo Gamecube for multiplayer games that used this functionality, and a headphone adaptor for the GBA SP.
* Original **Gameboy** which I use with Tetris.

### My PC and Console Games

I collect physical and digital games, both modern and retro. You should able to browse through the games I have, both on PC and console, here: [https://wordswords.github.io/media-library-homepage](https://wordswords.github.io/media-library-homepage)

I also have an install of [ExoDos](https://www.retro-exo.com/exodos.html) and [ExoWin31](https://www.retro-exo.com/win3x.html) on my media PC, which allows me to play any game ever released on DOS and Windows 3.1.

### Living Room TV Setup

We have a separate minimal setup in our living room which my wife uses heavily. It is minimal because she doesn't like overcomplicated tech stuff :) It consists of:

* Sony BRAVIA 2023 Edition, KD-43X75WL, 43 Inch, LED, Smart TV, 4K HDR, Google TV

Because it has Google TV, we can use the Plex app to wirelessly stream 4K videos from my Plex server, and it handles 4K videos well, which is not a small feat as the wireless signal is being blasted through a concrete wall :) Netflix and all the other standard services also work well.
