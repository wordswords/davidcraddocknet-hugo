Last year I was 'banned' from LinkedIn for calling three people 'idiots'. I thought it a little unfair at the time, particularly because they WERE being idiots, but there didn't seem to be any way to contest it, or even any way to get in contact with LinkedIn.

I had over 10k followers and I put a lot of care and effort into my posts on the site, and they were often very popular with people. Mostly I tried to help people, giving mentoring advice and commenting about diversity in the software industry, which was well-received.

Yesterday I asked a GenAI agent about what I could do to reinstate my account and it suggested that I contact the LinkedIn help team via X.com.

So I signed up to X.com, and wrote a long and careful message explaining my situation, explaining my mood had been affected at the time by cancer treatment, and asking them to reconsider the ban.

I logged in to X.com and found that I had been sent no reply at all and I was blocked from contacting the LinkedIn help team ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ

So yes, that's that. I guess.
