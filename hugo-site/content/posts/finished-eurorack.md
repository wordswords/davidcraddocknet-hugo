Finally I have finished my Eurorack synthesiser! And I know many people say that 'Euroracks are never finished' but this one absolutely has to be, for financial reasons. I think that I have got to a place where I have every major feature common in most synthesisers, but in a modular instrument format. It is a great place to learn about different synthesis techniques.
