title: 26/2/2021 DJ Setup with Diagrams

After the last post I have added Ableton Live and my Eurorack modular to my DJ setup, with a master clock being sent via MIDI cables from my Roland TR8 drum machine that syncs with Ableton. The drum machine also can be used creatively for drum fills etc.

I hope these two diagrams explain my setup adequately - sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words! The 'actor' is me - I just couldn't find a way to change that on http://draw.io :)
