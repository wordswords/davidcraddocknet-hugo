Someone made a comment the other day on a post I made on forum, that made me think.

My post was asking 'how to avoid becoming bitter and cynical as you age'. A pretty standard topic that I've seen affect many people as they get older.

I outlined my life story so far, how some of it has been great, and how some of it has not been so great, and what I've achieved.

The persons analysis was that, "From the sounds of things you've lived an incredible life with some wonderful experiences and shared them with the love of your life".

He then concluded with "Even if it all ends tomorrow, and the best times are in the past - you've already won at life. Be content with your life well lived!"

This genuinely made me think - what if he is right? What if I've been missing that fact that my life has been a 'success' already?

This has followed another comment recently from someone I know that doesn't like me, but knows me well, that 'anyone can see' that I have been successful.

Also my counsellor, who said that compared to ALL the rest of her clients, I am in a such as massively different position in what I have achieved and what advantages I have, and I should acknowledge and accept this.

So, I think it makes sense to write a post here to point this out - that I might have succeeded in a lot of other peoples view, and my own viewpoint doesn't match up to the reality of that.

I am so critical of myself, and take so many other peoples criticisms far too seriously, that I often forget to remember the alternative side of the coin.

So yes, that is what I wanted to post about. That is all.
