I have just seen [Yahoo! Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com), and am convinced this is going to change the web. For real.

Data source sites will become 'content providers', data will be aggregated and filtered from multiple content providers, either by the user or by 'intermediary' sites. The user will be able to choose his 'data view' of the content on the internet, just as Google is currently doing.

This is fascinating stuff if you're involved in the web industry.
