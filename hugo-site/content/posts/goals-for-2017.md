title: Goals for 2017

Looking at my past posts, you may notice that I didn't set myself any goals for 2016. Looking back, this was a mistake, so I'm going to remedy this by setting some for 2017.

Goals:

- Lose a significant amount of weight - this is very important for health reasons.
- Study maths courses - I intend to sign up for some maths courses at the OU. This will improve my mathematical knowledge, allowing for further study in subjects I'm interested in, plus allow me to work in more mathematically-heavy careers. This equates to 10 hours study per week, so it's not a light commitment, but one I think I need to make.
- Exercise more - this is important as it improves my mindset, stamina, and makes me feel good.

Not too many goals this time, but some important ones, and I think I'm in a good position to commit to these thanks to the support of my partner, and therefore I am in a position to improve my life.

Will post updates at some point during the year to chart this progress.
