I have added 'Mylar3' the electronic comic book downloader and metadata organiser, to my self-hosted docker containers.

It should do a better job than Calibre of going through my PDFs and CBR/CBZ files, as a lot of them are e-comic books.

LazyLibrarian did a good job of dealing with the metadata of my epub collection, I hope that Mylar3 can do an equally good job, although the task is far harder as there is less metadata existing in a lot of my e-comic book PDF files.

I will also have to implement, probably, another LazyLibrarian instance to process the PDF ebooks that I have which are not comics - there are many technology books and others in the 10,000+ collection.

So yes - small steps to a well-organised collection, but at least the epub metadata is looking good.

I also have been working on a PlayNite script to sort out a good set of icons, backgrounds and video trailers from my emulation ROM collections for SNES and Megadrive and others.

I am using the excellent EmuMovies Sync tool to download metadata, and I am working on a 'quick and dirty' set of scripts to import those image and video assets into PlayNite, for use with themes that support video trailers.

I don't really want to have to learn C# to the extent of writing a 'proper' plugin for the whole community, I would rather do it this way hacky way for my own use, but I'm sure others could expand on what I'm doing if they wanted to.

More on this project later when I've finished it.
