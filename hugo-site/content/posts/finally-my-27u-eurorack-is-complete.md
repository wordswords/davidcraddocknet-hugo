So.. finally my 27U Eurorack modular synthesiser is complete. I have filled up the third - and surely last, as there is no more room in the studio! - case. I started this Eurorack modular in 2015.. so I am glad it is all complete now. I put in a small amount nearly every month for new modules. I am not some 'rich kid' who could afford to buy everything at once - and indeed I think my gradual approach has benefitted the overall modular because it's made me think about what I actually need, and given me time to learn as I go along.

These are the details for the (newest) left section case:

Very happy!
