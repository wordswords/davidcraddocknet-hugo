NOTE: [I have an update on my progress as of 9/1/2015 here](http://www.davidcraddock.net/2015/09/01/goals-for-the-year-2015-midway-update/)

Motivated by my good friend [CheerUpLove.com](http://cheeruplove.com/)'s reflective style of blogging, and [Ian Forrester](http://cubicgarden.com)'s many interesting posts, I thought it would be interesting to post something a bit more personal and less technical on this blog.

Now that 2015 is upon us, I am going to take some time to publicly outline my goals for the year, so I can hold myself more accountable to them, and so I can look back on them this time next year.

### Career Goals

One of my most important goals at the moment is to settle into my new role at the BBC as Test Manager. It is a step up for me, and I want to prove my stripes. I also will be pushing for a place to be opened up with Platform Test to employ someone from the [Extend Scheme](http://www.bbc.co.uk/careers/trainee-schemes-and-apprenticeships/extend/extend "Extend Scheme").
**What Success Will Look Like :** Growing my team, Extendee placement, good performance reviews.

### Creative Goals

I have been improving my music production skills a great deal over the past year, a pastime that I find very rewarding. I have also started piano lessons, which I aim to continue with. I aim to continue getting better, and maybe to look into another evening music course - perhaps the Game Audio course at Futureworks Manchester.
**What Success Will Look Like :** Improved music posted to Soundcloud, collaborations with other musicians, better ability at piano

### Social Goals

Getting married is going to be the main point of the year for me, with the wedding coming in September. Lots of preparing to do. I also want to keep the good friendships that I have at the moment, but perhaps make some new friends, particularly those who are into the same interests as me
**What Success Will Look Like :** Becoming Mr. Lewin, making friends with more people that are interested in the same things as I am

### Financial Goals

I need to be saving more over the course of the year. I also want to join the BBC pension scheme, as I don't really have a pension yet
**What Success Will Look Like :** Significant savings at the end of the year, joining the pension scheme

### Health Goals

My fitness is something I need to become more serious about. I enjoy long-distance indoor rowing for stamina and fitness. I would like to do more of this, and there is a gym just down my road, so there isn't much excuse for me not to.
**What Success Will Look Like :** Adopt a regular form of keeping fit

So.. I will look back on this post through the year and hopefully it will motivate me to achieve these goals. Currently I think these goals are achievable, and I think 2015 will be a great year.
