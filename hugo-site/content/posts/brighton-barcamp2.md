I will be attending Brighton Barcamp 2 on the weekend of the 14th March, and presenting on a new web project I've been working on.

See: [http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampBrighton2](http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampBrighton2) and [http://www.barcampbrighton.org/](http://www.barcampbrighton.org/) for more info.

**_Update: Brighton Barcamp 2 is now over._**

This was really interesting, and I learned a huge amount in a very short amount of time. Thanks to everyone who talked to me. I'll definitely be attending future Barcamps.
