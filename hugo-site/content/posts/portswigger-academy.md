## Portswigger Academy

I have signed up to, and have been learning a lot from, the [Portswigger Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dashboard) using the Burp Suite Community Edition.

I have gone through all the 'Apprentice' labs, all 62 of them.

I honestly think web application pentesting is something that could suit me incredibly well, given my background in web developer and SDET work.

It's so much more interesting than the stuff I was doing before!

As soon as I can, I would love to purchase a license for the full version of Burp Suite, and start working on the other labs, with a view to take the certification they offer.

The only problem is that a yearly Burp Suite licence is Â£400, which is a bit above my budget at the moment.

However, the features of the Burp Suite Professional Edition are so much more advanced than the Community Edition, that I think it would be worth it.

I still hate the name though.
