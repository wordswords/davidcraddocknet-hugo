title: Pivoting to Platform Engineer Roles
url: /platform-engineer

---

So finally, after a whole lot of introspection, and a lot of research, I am planning to pivot my tech career into 'Platform Engineer'.

I already have a lot of the skills required. I can use Bash, Python, CI/CD, Docker, Docker Compose, basic networking and routing, and I know quite a bit about AWS.

Platform Engineer roles are a type of dev ops role that is 1) In demand 2) Builds on my existing knowledge 3) Is obtainable and 4) Offers a lot of 'remote only' work.

## Learning Plan

The plan is to 'prove' my AWS knowledge by going ahead and sitting the AWS Solution Architect exam, and gaining the certificate.

Then I want to build up my Kubernetes knowledge.

Everyone says the path of learning: Linux -> Docker -> Networking -> Kubernetes is the way to go, so I'm going to follow that path.

## Learning Resources

I am using [https://cantrill.io](https://cantrill.io) to learn AWS, and to study for the AWS Solution Architect exam.

I will be using the following books from my personal software engineering library:

* [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58063548-understanding-kubernetes-in-a-visual-way](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58063548-understanding-kubernetes-in-a-visual-way)
* [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56866821-quick-start-kubernetes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56866821-quick-start-kubernetes)
* [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35494978-the-kubernetes-book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35494978-the-kubernetes-book)

## Hobby Projects

I am also building a K8's cluster of 2 RPI Zero 2s, while running a controller on my Kali Linux server.

I will look at putting services such as SWAG (docker compose secure web application web server) and Pi-Hole (DNS server) on the cluster.

What happens sometimes is that I have to reboot my main Kali Linux server, and it would be nice to have high availability backups of these two services so that they keep working regardless of the status of the server.

## Updates

Watch this space for more updates soon - I aim to go 100% hardcore on learning what I need to know to secure a first 'Platform Engineer' role.
