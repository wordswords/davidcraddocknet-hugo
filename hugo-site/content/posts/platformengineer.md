title: Pivoting to Platform Engineer Roles
url: /platform-engineer

---

So finally, after a whole lot of introspection, and a lot of research, I am planning to pivot my tech career into 'Platform Engineer'.

I already have a lot of the skills required. I can use Bash, Python, CI/CD, Docker, Docker Compose, basic networking and routing, and I know quite a bit about AWS.

The plan is to 'prove' my AWS knowledge by going ahead and sitting the AWS Solution Architect exam, and gaining the certificate.

Then I want to build up my Kubernates knowledge.

Everyone says the path of learning: Linux -> Docker -> Networking -> Kubernates is the way to go, so I'm going to follow that path.

I am using [https://cantrill.io](https://cantrill.io) to learn AWS, and to study for the AWS Solution Architect exam.

Platform Engineer roles are a type of dev ops role that is 1) In demand 2) Builds on my existing knowledge 3) Is obtainable and 4) Offers a lot of 'remote only' work.

Watch this space for more updates soon - I aim to go 100% hardcore on learning what I need to know to secure a first 'Platform Engineer' role.
