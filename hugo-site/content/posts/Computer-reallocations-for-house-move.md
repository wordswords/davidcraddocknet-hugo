We will, in a few months (fingers crossed) be moving home. We currently live in quite a large house, and it's just the two of us. We should end up in a new build flat, with a lot smaller living space than I'm used to.

To deal with that, I need to downsize my technical setup.

I currently have a seperate 'work from home' desk and a seperate 'gaming and media' desk - there will be only one desk possible.

I have also taken over my wife's gaming PC, as she doesn't use it anymore.

So, my plans are - to convert study.local - the Linux workstation, into a dedicated 'network security box'. I will fit it with dual 10Gb/sec adaptors, and it will sit between my ISP and the rest of my network.

I do not know whether I can really expect 2Gbits/sec firewall and IDS real-time analysis performance out of it - I will have to see - I somewhat doubt it, due to the old hardware it uses. I am sure there are some meaningful network security things it can do though.

I will be creating a new single computing setup for the new place, with a single large standing desk. It will consist of:

* Large black ikea standing desk
* 32" HDR10 1440p IPS monitor and monitor arm
* Secondary gaming monitor, 27" in portrait mode
* 2x Genelec speakers and sub woofer
* Laptop docking station setup with gaming laptop cooling pad
* Rack with sound interface in sitting in it
* 2x Balance boards
* Herman Miller Aeron chair
* Standing desk mat
* R0de procaster Boom mic
* Key light for webcam calls
* A webcam.. Probably the Facecam webcam if I can get it working properly
* 'Big Knob' volume control for the speakers
* 2x USB charging stations for peripherals
* Kenesis Split ergonomic keyboard AND Topre Realforce keyboard - not sure which I will use mainly, probably the Topre
* Vertical ergonomic mouse for working and horiziontal gaming mouse for gaming
* Phillips Hue lightstrip under the desk for ambient lighting
* As many phillips hue lightsources as practical to fit in, so that I can have a phillips hue entertainment area
* Cup holders for drinks
* Mini fridge
* Space for vertical incense burner + insence
* At least 2 Honeywell fans, likely mounted on the wall, and controlled by Google Home assistant voice commands
* Portable low energy oil-based  heater assuming it gets cold in the new place - controlled by Google Home assistant commands

Separately, most likely mounted on custom built shelves on the wall, I want to have my complete retro games console setup accessible and routable to the main monitors. Because I will be using wireless controllers on each console, I should be able to play all games consoles without having much problem.

I also want to put on the wall my most commonly used peripherals, such as steering wheel and HOTAS joysticks, and the ability to quickly put them into use for a game using quick-release mounts.

I will be taking the network cabinet and the music equipment rack with me, as they should be able to be easily housed in the new place, and because they will be essential for what I want to do.

The music rack will have be located next to the computer setup, so that I can use my sound interface. It would also be really nice if I had a little shelf for my record deck, so I can play records on the new setup, and storage space for the records - but that might be asking too much!

Then the network security box (the old Study.local) and the server will be situated in a dust-free setup raised from the floor, with 10Gb/sec network to all devices.

It is possible that the firewall box, network cabinet and the server can be located in a different room than the computer setup, so it could perhaps go in the living room, to save space.

Ideally I want enough floor space around the computer setup so that two people can effectively sit there and play 2 player games, and/or I can use the VR headset and wii montion controls. But I'll have to see what is available.

I also want this computer setup next to a window with good natural light and blackout curtains, as I will be using this setup a lot!
