I first started programming in 1998. I have over 20 years commercial experience in industry. To be honest, I've been out of full-time work for the majority of the past 4 years, with the exception of last year where I worked for the majority of it as a top-tier Principal Consulting Engineer.

A lot of time in the past 4 years has been taken up with treatment for health problems, from which I am now fully recovered from. During this time I worked extensively on my own personal projects and upskilled myself in my spare time simply because I found it fun.

I am currently studying a masters degree full-time in Cyber Security at a top tier Uni. I hope to work in Cyber Security after this.

I don't actually know how working in Cyber Security in a technical role will be like, whether I'll actually get a job at all, or whether I will be passed over in preference of new grads so that the hiring manager doesn't feel intimidated by the person they're managing. Or that they think they can 'mold' them to their own (inexperienced) opinions or whatever.

I just know that I enjoy learning about Cyber Security, I enjoy doing technical work, I have undertaken tons and tons of personal technical projects in my spare time (see [https://davidcraddock.net](https://davidcraddock.net)) and learning on my own time - so I am very passionate about it.

Whether I will be able to work in the industry isn't really a question of up-to-date skills or passion, or even salary, it's rather a question of the personal fit for me, my personality and my extensively educated and experienced-defined opinions, in the organisations and organisational hierarchies that happen to be hiring at the time.
