The house is in the final stages of being sold, and so I have taken down the house server down while we move.

This is the server that self-hosts all my domains, including this website.

In the meantime while it's down, I have created a mirror of the hugo site automatically deploying on commit to wordswords.github.io - my static github pages site.

This should work for this domain only, but not other domains, such as davidcraddock.games because this is all I've had time to do.

In the future, I hope to setup a complete github actions workflow to properly mirror all of my domain sites to github's static pages, so it is easy to redirect to them when the server is down.
