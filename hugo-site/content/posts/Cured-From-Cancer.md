I have been officially classed as 'cured' from my Relapsed Hodgkins Lymphoma cancer, which I was first diagnosed with at Stage 4 in 2021 and came back at Stage 3 in the same year.

The past 4 years have been very, very difficult, not just on me but everyone close to me. But I'm glad to say I can 'close the cancer chapter' and move on to the next stage of my life.

I have been left with no long-term issues, apart from a slightly weakened immune system and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. My long term prognosis is extremely good, and I'm expected to live for several decades at least.

I am fitter than I have been for years, as I cycle several times per week at the moment, eat fairly well, and rarely drink alcohol, and don't smoke etc (I've never smoked).

So yes - good news, really :)
