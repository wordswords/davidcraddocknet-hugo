* One trick I used to great affect with my previous [Amazon Alexa])(https://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&node=14100223031) setup, was a central [Google personal calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?pli=1) that was linked to wake up routines - it would, reliably, read out all the events on my calendar on that day. I found that hugely helpful.

* Since moving to [Morgen, the best calendar app I've ever used])(https://www.morgen.so/), and [Google Home assistant](https://store.google.com/gb/product/nest_hub_2nd_gen?hl=en-GB&utm_medium=google_oo&utm_campaign=GS107430&pli=1) instead of Alexa, I've lost that calendar sync function.

* Thankfully, the paid edition of Morgen has a new feature that allows you to create 'workflows' where you can automatically schedule tasks to keep any number of Google Calendars in sync.

* Therefore I am finally able to have my Morgen calendar not just shared across all my computing devices (which Morgen does by default, having a client available for all devices), but also with Google Home Assistant, which allows me to listen to my itinerary for the day on [Google Home Assistant speakers](https://assistant.google.com/intl/en_uk/platforms/speakers/#find-speakers) and [Google Home Assistant displays](https://store.google.com/gb/product/nest_hub_2nd_gen?hl=en-GB&utm_medium=google_oo&utm_campaign=GS107430&pli=1), which I have many around our house.

* [Morgen Workflows](https://www.morgen.so/guides/how-to-use-morgens-calendar-propagation-workflow) goes beyond mimicking my pre-existing Alexa workflow functionality, however, by also calculating and booking out the travel time needed for me to get to an event that has a location. It calculates the time using your home address and chosen method of transport (I always choose 'public transport' to be on the safe side).

* As I have at least one [Google Nest Home Smart Display](https://store.google.com/gb/product/nest_hub_2nd_gen?hl=en-GB&utm_medium=google_oo&utm_campaign=GS107430&pli=1) it also shows a calendar-like display of my events coming up, for greater easy of reading, on my desks.
