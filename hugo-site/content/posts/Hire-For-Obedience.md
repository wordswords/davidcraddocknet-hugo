It is true that employers these days are hiring for obedience and inexperience, as this ebook excerpt explains:

--

“We regret to inform you that we will not be moving forward with your application due to concerns that your qualifications exceed those required for the role.

We feel it would not be a good fit. Thank you for applying.”

Ouch, that’s part of a rejection email a very experienced job candidate sent me.

An employer had sent it to them after the first interview.

Another job candidate, this one with a PhD and several other advanced degrees,

told me this recently…

“I feel like I’m both overqualified and underqualified for the jobs I apply to Isaiah.”

Which do you feel is more of a problem for you? I asked.

“At first I thought it was the fact that I didn’t have enough skills, but I’ve had 2 first round interviews now and both employers asked me why I wanted the position.”

And? I asked.

“And I answered but they didn’t seem to like my answer and kept asking me why I wanted to get hired into their position with as much experience and education that I had. They acted like I was at the top of my field or something.”

“You are.” I said…

If you have 5 or more years of experience in a full-time, salaried industry job, you’re in the top 10% of your field.

If you’re over 40 years old and have experience in a full-time, salaried position, you’re in the top 2%.

Less than 10% of today’s 1st world employees have a Masters degree.

Less than 2% have a doctorate degree. Even having a Bachelors degree puts you in the top 35% of the 1st world in terms of education.

This makes you rare.

Or, in the eyes of a hiring manager today - an aberration.

A likely expensive aberration who is hard to keep happy. (From their point of view.)
