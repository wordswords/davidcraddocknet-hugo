I've been trying to learn a lot about search engines lately, as I've been starting at an internet marketing firm. I found this excellent list of online materials for university courses related to search engines:

[http://clair.si.umich.edu:8080/wordpress/?p=11](http://clair.si.umich.edu:8080/wordpress/?p=11)

In particular, these seem especially relevant:

- The Structure of Information Networks - [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs685/2002fa/](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs685/2002fa/) (a good introduction)
- Search Engine Technology - [http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~radev/SET07.htm](http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~radev/SET07.html) (a great course)
- Information Retreival and Web Search - [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/ir-course/](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/ir-course/) (less math than the columbia course, and thus somewhat easier follow)
- Networked Life - [http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/NetworkedLife/](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/NetworkedLife/) \- (a course on networked societies for humanities students, relavent to social networks and such)
