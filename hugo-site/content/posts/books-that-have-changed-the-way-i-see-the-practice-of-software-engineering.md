A lot of good sense. I can't believe there are people out there in charge of software projects that haven't read this book, or think it somehow doesn't apply anymore, but unfortunately, it seems quite common. -

Really blew my mind. -

Made me think that organisational positive change to a more healthy collaborative style of working is both possible and achievable. Even though I've never personally witnessed a change of any remotely similar magnitude happen at an organisation I've ever worked at -

Even though I don't agree with some of its points, such as the emphasis on story points, I don't have a problem with a lot of the original intentions behind the idea. Just the overwhelmingly poor examples of its implementation that I've experienced. -

Well, suffice to say, they never bothered to read this book.

Also the most well-written technical book I've ever read. -
