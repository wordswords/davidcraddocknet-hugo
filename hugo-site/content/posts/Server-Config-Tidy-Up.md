I have spent a lot of time tidying up my hq.local server config, the IOC code that hosts all my services, including my Plex server, my full set of arr services,my calibre libraries, my SWAG Hugo blog sites, and various indexing, conversion and backup scripts.

It should all be a lot easier to maintain going forward, and just 'work'. That's the intention anyway. For me to spend more time actually consuming the media on my digital media collection than collecting, indexing and maintaining the collection.

A lofty goal.
