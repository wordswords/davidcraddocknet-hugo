# My Calibre Libraries

On hq.local, I have two [https://calibre-ebook.com/](Calibre) libraries, one for EPUBs, and one for PDFs/comics.

## Hosting

* They are managed by [https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-calibre/](Server.io's Calibre docker containerised services). They are both running Calibre content server to serve directly to my e-readers. [https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated](I also use Calibre Web Automated docker containerised services) for both libraries.
* So in total, there are three services hosted, and three ways of accessing each calibre library, per library - 1) the calibre application running via remote desktop, which I use for serious administration 2) The Calibre content server accessible on my e-readers and 3) The Calibre Web interface which I use to browse and read the books on computers.

## Size

There are approximately 80,000 books across both libraries.

## Sources

* I have built them up primarily from [HumbleBundle.com](https://HumbleBundle.com) book purchases, where the majority of the money goes to charity, and I still get a good lot of ebooks.
* I also 'inherited' a large collection of already DRM-stripped fiction books from a friend.
* Occasionally I use resources such as Anna's Archive to download DRM-stripped books.

## Access

Both libraries are accessible via my [https://www.zerotier.com/](ZeroTier VPN). I use the [https://www.moondownload.com](Moon Reader) application on Android devices to access the Calibre content server port, and I use the Calibre content server web interface on my [https://www.kobo.com/](Kobo H20 E-reader).

I use the books in both for recreational reading, (mostly comics and some written fiction) and research for work.

## Reading

I have three e-readers.

* A 2020 [Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle-paperwhite-2024) which is not used with Calibre, instead it's used with the 100 or so books I have bought on Kindle throughout the years.
* A [https://uk.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-h2o](Kobo H20 e-reader) which is used for EPUBs only, and can access the Calibre EPUBs content server via wi-fi while I'm in the house to download books.
* A cheap 2024 Lenovo android tablet, which I use for both PDFs/comics and EPUBs, via the [https://www.moondownload.com/])(Moon Reader Android app). It also has a SIM card with a 4G data connection with a small amount of monthly data use quota, so I can connect to my VPN and download books while out of the house. This is my preferred e-reader at the moment due to the good quality colour display, which is good for reading PDFs/comics. I have stripped all the other applications and distractions off there.

I also have [https://www.moondownload.com/](Moon Reader) on my Android mobile phone, with access again to both libraries via VPN.

## Other Libraries

* I have a separate collection of over 400 physical books which I keep catalogued on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/22437975).
* I have a small collection of around 100 Kindle DRM'd books which I'm slowly cataloguing on ([https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/22437975](GoodReads, on the Kindle shelf).
* I have a small collection of around 100 Kobo store DRM'd books which I'm slowly cataloguing on [https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/22437975](GoodReads, on the Kobo shelf).
