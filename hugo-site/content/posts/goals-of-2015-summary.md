title: Goals of 2015 Summary
url: /2016/01/17/2015-goals-summary/

---
At the start of 2015, I wrote down [some goals for 2015](http://www.davidcraddock.net/2015/01/17/goals-for-the-year-2015/). Around half-way through the year, I revisited these goals with [some thoughts on how well I'd done](http://www.davidcraddock.net/2015/09/01/goals-for-the-year-2015-midway-update/). Now 2015 is over, I want to reflect on what has been achieved and what hasn't.

I also want to comment on the fact that I am discussing personal things here. A few years ago I was decided that I was going to keep this blog professional and pretty much dry of any thoughts or feelings on my personal life. I have moved away from that though, inspired by blogs such as [Iain's](http://www.cubicgarden.com), where personal thoughts and feelings are mixed with technical observations. I would like to think that this isn't a bad move; after all if potential employers come to look at this 5 years from now, and don't like what I've done here, then I probably don't want to work for them anyway. There is the argument that blogs should be 'themed' or targetted towards a particular subject to garner followers, and that too much sharing is possibly a bad thing. However, my current thoughts are that dry techncial info is boring, and I'd rather mix it with other things that are important to me.

### Retrospective for 2015

With that said.. 2015 was an eventful year, some things were awesome, some not.

The "Not Awesome"

My mum started treatment for cancer, which is a non-curable kind, Myeloma. The treatment was a success and she is currently in remission for the time being, so that is a good thing, but how long she will stay in remission we do not know. Both my remaining grandparents also sadly passed away. I also split up with my girlfriend of 5 years, which was difficult and still haunts me to a certain degree.

The "Awesome"

The money that my parents were going to put towards the wedding of the ex-girlfriend, they gave to me so I could put a deposit down on a house. So in August I bought and moved into a house in Withington, which I am in the process of doing up. It is _incredibly_ cheap to buy in Manchester compared to the south-east of England, where I'm originally from, where the dream of having my own 3 bed, semi-detached house would not be possible in any area with a reasonable number of IT jobs in short distance. I don't drive, so the fact that the tram stop is 10 minutes walk away is great for getting to work.

I met my current girlfriend, Conny in May, and things seem to be going very well; she is even planning to move from Berlin to Manchester to live with me. This is obviously great, and I don't know where I would be without her support.

Work

With all these things happening in my personal life, work took a secondary focus as I got things sorted. It also made me rethink what I wanted from my career. At the start of 2015 I had a new role, as Test Manager; the first level of technical management in my area at the BBC, and a big career move for me. Although I liked some aspects of the management role, I missed the technical challenges that had pretty much characterised the last 10 years of my career. There was not much direct coding, and I felt I was in danger of losing that aspect of my work. I took a 6 month attachment to R&D, which had me working in an extremely challenging technical role, on a HTML5 360 VR engine. In April when this attachment ends, I am looking to continue in a technical role of some description, and not return to pure management, at least for the meantime.

### Goals of 2015 - How Did I Do?

 **Work Goals**

- _Settle into my new role at the BBC as Test Manager_ \- As I mentioned before I've taken a move towards another route in my career
- _Pushing for a place to be opened up in Platform Test to employ someone from the Extend Scheme_ \- This was achieved, and [Ben](https://twitter.com/bmustillrose) has joined the BBC on an Extend placement.

**Creative Goals**

- _Get better at music production_ \- This has been achieved. I worked with my friend Gio, who taught me quite a few tricks about Ableton. I have [released a 3-track EP called 'Planetary Orbital' on Bandcamp](http://cachebuster.bandcamp.com/releases). I am also [helping to organise a Music Production Meetup.com in Manchester](http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Synth-and-Electronic-Music-Production-Group/).

**Social Goals**

- _Getting married_ \- Nope. Maybe later.
- _Making friends with more people that share the same interests_ \- Partly achieved. The Meetup groups will help this. I have also helped start a ['Virtual Reality Manchester' Meetup group, for VR fans in Manchester](http://www.meetup.com/VRManchester), the first meetup is next month.

**Financial Goals**

- _Saving more over the course of the year_ \- Partly achieved. I have bought a house, so now I am in a quite a bit of debt, but the money I will be putting towards my mortgage will be money I am effectively 'saving' because it will be put into the value of the house.
- _Joining a pension scheme_ \- Achieved.

**Health Goals**

_Adopt a regular form of keeping fit_ \- Partly achieved. I have now setup a return commute which involves walking past a gym that I'm a member of, so it is quite easy to go in there for 30 mins on the treadmill 2-3 times a week. I've just got to maintain the discipline.
