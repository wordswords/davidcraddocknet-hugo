So today I finally ordered an 8TB moving platter disk drive so that I can expand the home server - hq.local.

hq.local currently has about 19TB in disk space, almost all of which is fully utilised currently.

The extra space will mean that I can rip more Blu-rays to put on the Plex server, and download more things through the `*arr` services.

It has been frustrating being limited by hard disk space for at least 6 months, but before I simply could not afford a meaningful upgrade.

Thanks to Amazon offering refurbished enterprise storage drives at a very cheap price, I can finally upgrade.

I can also use this space to run more docker containers and VMs which will help my security learning.
