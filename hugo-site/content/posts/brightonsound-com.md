[We've been working on a Brighton music events Google maps mashup project:](http://www.brightonsound.com) [www.BrightonSound.com](http://www.BrightonSound.com)

It's still developing, but it looks quite good, and we're ready to start showing it off to people. So check it out!

**UPDATE: This project is now defunct after running for several years, and is no longer hosted. But thanks for the interest!**
