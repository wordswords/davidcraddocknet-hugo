  <div class="post-content"><p><img loading="lazy" src="/hugo-uploads/2024/8/3/biketrailer.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Every year I&rsquo;ve been doing these &lsquo;retrospectives&rsquo;, usually once per year but sometimes a couple of times per year.</p>
<p>Things have changed quite significantly since <a href="http://davidcraddock.net/2023/11/25/retrospective-for-2023/">the last retrospective</a>, and I was in a pensive mood, so I thought I would write a retrospective for half the year.</p>
<p>I finally found a job, with CGI, early in the year, and started in March 2023. Unfortunately, for reasons I&rsquo;m contractually obliged not to get into, it wasn&rsquo;t long before I was looking for work again. I resigned from CGI at the end of June.</p>
<p>I currently am going through the paperwork to start at my new employer, BAE.</p>
<p>These large companies take a long time to onboard and there is so much paperwork and checking, but that&rsquo;s just the nature of the industry and their size.</p>
<p>I am really looking forward to start at BAE as my finances have taken quite a hit from the 12 months I had to take off work for cancer treatment, and the subsequent struggle I had to find work after that gap on my CV.</p>
<p>In the meantime I&rsquo;ve been keeping busy, working on my hobby technology projects, but also spending a lot of time cycling on my electric mountain bike <a href="http://davidcraddock.net/my-bike/">http://davidcraddock.net/my-bike/</a>. I aim to cycle every day, and I have bought many accessories and support gear to make that happen. So far I have noticed a real improvement in my health and fitness and energy levels, and I absolutely WILL keep this daily cycling a feature of my life when I start work again.</p>
<p>It has been hugely beneficial for my mental and physical health, and just general independence, as I cannot drive, and never have been able to, and neither can my wife.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve stopped DJing regularly, and sold my DJ equipment. This was a positive step, as I wasn&rsquo;t happy doing the DJing regularly - it was amazing when I first started DJing on Twitch.tv, but recently it&rsquo;s just been a huge effort to get motivated to do it - just about everything has changed about the community since I started doing it around lockdown time. With the new <a href="https://twitch.tv">Twitch.tv</a> &rsquo;tax&rsquo; on DJing I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to make any money to cover my costs at all, which was something I was very happy I was able to do for the 3-4 years I was doing it. So I am glad I stopped.</p>
<p>I have been working on other side-incomes, such as my professional career tutoring for software/IT technical people, and selling stuff via eBay, not just my stuff (we have had a huge declutter of the house) but selling things for friends who are not able to sell them themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also spent a lot of time working on my home <a href="https://plex.tv">Plex Server</a>, which now has nearly 300 films and nearly 50 TV series on it. I have been ripping films from Blu-rays I buy second-hand, and then donating those Blu-rays to charity shops in Withington. It gives me a lot of pleasure to be able to donate the amount I have. I have also ripped my entire CD collection (over 300 CDs) and given them away to charity.</p>
<p>In terms of cancer, I am still cancer-free, and it has been over 1 year since my stem cell transplant. If I make it to 2 years the doctors told me I can consider myself essentially &lsquo;cured&rsquo;. The risk of cancer returning is highest in the first few months after the stem cell transplant, so by now there is very little chance that I will not be cured.</p>
<p>The clinical trial that I was a part of was such a success that the drug I was on - &lsquo;<a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/nivolumab">Nivolumab</a>&rsquo; has been approved as a treatment for the type of cancer I had. So I am glad that I was able to contribute to cancer research (and also directly benefit from it!).</p>
<p>We have a new Labour government, which I&rsquo;m SO VERY happy about, having been a long-term supporter of the Labour Party for many years. One of the things that kept me going throughout cancer treatment was the hope that I&rsquo;d live to see another Labour government, and indeed I did.</p>
<p>Conny has moved to part-time working now I am able to work full-time again, and she is so much happier - she is smiling nearly all the time, and I&rsquo;ve really noticed a change in her. She has done an absolute ton of things around the house, including completely transforming the rear and front gardens.</p>
<p>I am very happy with the way things are going with us, and it really feels like we have come out of a really horrendous time and things are getting a lot better for us.</p>
<p>So yes, that is the update for mid 2024, really quite positive compared to my last update, and indeed the last few updates. Long may this positivity continue.</p>
