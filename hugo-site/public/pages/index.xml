      <description>&amp;ldquo;vWorkbench&amp;rdquo; is my own personal Vim9-based development environment and writing environment that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to &amp;lsquo;spin out&amp;rsquo; into an open source project that is stable enough, reusable enough and well-documented enough to be used by others.
https://github.com/wordswords/vWorkbench.git - this is the current version of my development environment that I use as much as possible, both in personal and work situations.
https://github.com/wordswords/vWorkbench/blob/master/README.md - this is the documentation on my development environment, which I absolutely try and keep up to date.</description>

      <title>Security Research</title>

      <description>I am currently familiarising myself with tools to implement cyber security solutions.
This is in preparation for my research project as part of the MSc Cyber Security masters I&amp;rsquo;m taking from the University of London via distance learning.
This research is strictly for informational purposes and I don&amp;rsquo;t do anything criminal with it.
I realise some of this information may be seen as &amp;lsquo;over-sharing&amp;rsquo; and is a security risk in itself, but I believe that the benefits of sharing this information outweigh the risks, and that there is no &amp;lsquo;security via obscurity&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>I use this setup, along with my bike to work from wherever I want.
It does kind of turn heads, and I&amp;rsquo;m aware it may look a little &amp;lsquo;over the top&amp;rsquo; - but it&amp;rsquo;s a very useful setup for me, keeps me healthy, and fits all my requirements.
Hercules DG400BB Laptop Stand w/ Bag - this portable laptop stand is very sturdy and is designed for mobile DJ use. I find it is excellent in all situations, not just DJ use.</description>

      <description>I have a fibre to the house 2Gb/sec connection provided by BRSK, who I really recommend. This means that maximum download speeds are 250 megabytes per second, although often this is throttled at the source level. My home network routes at around 2-4gbit/sec between 10gbit/sec DAC fibre connected hosts, and around 2gbit/sec via CAT8 for Thunderbolt 2.5Ggbit/sec laptop network interfaces. We two Ubiquiti wireless APs in a mesh configuration, with seperate SSIDs for 2Ghz, 5Ghz, guest and IOT networks.</description>

      <description>Audio and music has always been a big part of my life, which I used to actively pursue in the evenings while working in software/IT.
I have DJ&amp;rsquo;d semi-professionally, with stints in club residencies, mobile DJing and Twitch DJing, for over a decade. I also produced and released several electronica albums. I have done paid freelance work on sound design and studio building. I studied the core parts of a Bachelors degree in Sound Engineering and Music Production, as a distance learning course while I was working full-time, at the excellent Point Blank Music School in London.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked writing and have been doing it for a long time. I write a lot for work, and also have written a lot of creative writing.
Work Essays and Articles I&amp;rsquo;m working on a way to format and structure these properly within Hugo. For now though, the following will have to do.Alternatively, you can always view them in markdown in the Github repository at the link here:</description>
