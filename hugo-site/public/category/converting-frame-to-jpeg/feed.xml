      <description>I needed to view a single frame of a m2v file that had been encoded by our designers for playing out on TV. The file name was .mpg but in actuality it was a single .m2v frame renamed to be a .mpg. Windows Media Player classic used to display the frame fine when I opened the file normally, under Windows XP. However now I have switched to a Mac, I have found that Quicktime and VLC refused to display the single frame.</description>

<p>I needed to view a single frame of a m2v file that had been encoded by our designers for playing out on TV. The file name was .mpg but in actuality it was a single .m2v frame renamed to be a .mpg. Windows Media Player classic used to display the frame fine when I opened the file normally, under Windows XP. However now I have switched to a Mac, I have found that Quicktime and VLC refused to display the single frame. I couldn&rsquo;t find a video player that would open the single frame. So I resorted to the command line version of ffmpeg, which I installed via macports, to convert this single frame to a jpg file to view as normal. This line worked a treat:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ffmpeg -i north.mpg -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:00:1 -s 1024x768 -r 1 -f mjpeg north.jpg
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Where &rsquo;north.mpg&rsquo; was the m2v file, and &rsquo;north.jpg&rsquo; was the output jpeg.</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>find -name *.mpg -exec ffmpeg -i {} -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:00:1 -s 1024x768 -r 1 -f mjpeg {}.jpg ;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Will go through all the mpg files in the current directory and below, and create their jpeg single frame equivalents, ie: for north.mpg it will create north.mpg.jpg.</p>
