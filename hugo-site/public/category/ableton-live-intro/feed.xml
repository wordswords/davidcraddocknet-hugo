      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to dabble in making and playing music. Here is the equipment and setup that I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ableton Live Intro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the DAW I use. I have been using Ableton Live for several years now, and I know my way around it. I have tried others but they never really felt as comfortable. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ableton.com/en/live/feature-comparison/&#34;&gt;Live comes in three flavours&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;lsquo;Intro&amp;rsquo; is the most basic paid-for version. I was surprised how cheap the &amp;lsquo;Intro&amp;rsquo; version was, and how little I find myself needing the features of the more expensive versions. I only have one paid-for VST plugin, and that is the KORG Legacy Cell MS-20, which I use on almost all the music I&amp;rsquo;ve made.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
