      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I got given a Digi 002 console version, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fairly old style digital audio interface and mixer, which was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec02/articles/digi002.asp&#34;&gt;all the rage back in 2002&lt;/a&gt; when it first came out, but now is often found sitting in the skip. Why? Because it is a Pro-Tools inteface, and Avid stopped supporting it about 5 years ago, so it won&amp;rsquo;t actually work under Pro Tools and Windows 10 (believe me, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried!). It only works as a recording interface through Pro Tools, so you can&amp;rsquo;t just connect it via firewire to your PC and expect it to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a problem I frequently encouter on Redhat/Fedora/CentOS systems with the output of the &lt;strong&gt;ls&lt;/strong&gt; command. Under those distributions, the default setup is to display directories in a very dark colour. If you usually use a white foreground and a black background on your terminal client (such as Putty) then you will struggle to read the names of the directories under Redhat-based distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two soloutions that I have used:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
