      <description>&lt;p&gt;2015 Update: The &amp;ldquo;Device Hive&amp;rdquo; project has now been changed to be called &amp;lsquo;Hive CI&amp;rsquo; and it is being maintained by a team of developers at the BBC, which I am no longer a part of. It is in the process of being opensourced, see: &lt;a href=&#34;http://bbc.github.io/hive-ci/&#34;&gt;http://bbc.github.io/hive-ci/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year has been quite a busy and eventful one for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connected Red Button&lt;/strong&gt; At the start of the year, I was working on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/posts/connected_red_button_launch&#34;&gt;Connected Red Button&lt;/a&gt; team within the BBC. Connected Red Button is a major ongoing project in the Television and Mobile Platforms department at BBC North. Its aim is to replace the classic Red Button text service (which itself is the successor to Ceefax) with a new updated all-singing all-dancing interactive portal to internet content, available on Smart TVs and modern set top boxes. Currently Connected Red Button is live and accessible by pressing the Red Button on the new Virgin Media TiVo boxes. You can access the latest version of iPlayer, and the BBC News and BBC Sport smart TV apps from within one easy portal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
