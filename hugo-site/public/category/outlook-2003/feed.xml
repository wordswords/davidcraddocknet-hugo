      <description>&lt;p&gt;At work, I still have to use Windows XP and Outlook 2003. I don&amp;rsquo;t particually mind this, except when I draft an email to someone and accidently I press Control-B instead of Control-V. Control-B will go ahead and send your partially composed email, resulting in some embarassment as you have to tell everyone to disregard it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to remove the &amp;lsquo;send email&amp;rsquo; shortcut keys in Outlook 2003. There are two ways of doing this, one involves editing your group policy, which is something only my IT administration team can do, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to involve them. The other way is by making a change to your registry, which I will describe here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
