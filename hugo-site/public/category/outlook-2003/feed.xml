      <description>At work, I still have to use Windows XP and Outlook 2003. I don&amp;rsquo;t particually mind this, except when I draft an email to someone and accidently I press Control-B instead of Control-V. Control-B will go ahead and send your partially composed email, resulting in some embarassment as you have to tell everyone to disregard it.
So I wanted to remove the &amp;lsquo;send email&amp;rsquo; shortcut keys in Outlook 2003. There are two ways of doing this, one involves editing your group policy, which is something only my IT administration team can do, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to involve them.</description>

I don&rsquo;t particually mind this, except when I draft an email to someone and accidently I press Control-B instead of Control-V. Control-B will go ahead and send your partially composed email, resulting in some embarassment as you have to tell everyone to disregard it.</p>
<p>So I wanted to remove the &lsquo;send email&rsquo; shortcut keys in Outlook 2003. There are two ways of doing this, one involves editing your group policy, which is something only my IT administration team can do, and I didn&rsquo;t want to have to involve them. The other way is by making a change to your registry, which I will describe here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open up regedit, and browse to the following registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER -&gt; Software -&gt; Policies -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; office -&gt; 11.0 -&gt; outlook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then create a new key called: &ldquo;DisabledShortcutKeysCheckBoxes&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under that key, create two new String Values:
Name: CtrlB Data: 66,8
Name: CtrlEnter Data: 13,8</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then restart Outlook and those keys will be disabled.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Click on the thumbnail below to see what the finished edit should look like:</p>
