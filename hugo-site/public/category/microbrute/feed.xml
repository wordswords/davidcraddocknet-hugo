      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought some new synths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;access-virus-a&#34;&gt;Access Virus A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the original &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vintagesynth.com/misc/virusa.php&#34;&gt;1998 Access Virus A&lt;/a&gt;. It, it was a staple synth for trance and electronic music in general for the early 00s. I am very happy that I managed to get this secondhand for less than a MicroKORG. It cost over Â£800 when it came out in 1998. Old digital synths seem to be unpopular at the moment, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard comments along the lines of &amp;lsquo;if it&amp;rsquo;s digital then I might as well use a plugin in my DAW&amp;rsquo;. But I think this is ignoring the tactile control surface that you get, and how it gets your head outside the computer and playing an actual physical instrument. The presets are really inspiring, several sounds that you will recognise if you were into electronic music in the 00s. VNV Nation, one of my favourite bands, produced their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDPwv0n8LzY&#34;&gt;entire &amp;lsquo;Empires&amp;rsquo; album&lt;/a&gt; with just the Access Virus A and a couple of samplers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
