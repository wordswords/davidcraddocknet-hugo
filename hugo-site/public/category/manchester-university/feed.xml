      <description>Recently, myself and two colleagues from the BBC, ran a session on Test Driven Development at the Manchester University &amp;lsquo;Ultimate Programming&amp;rsquo; society. The society is a gathering where students discuss cool things they have done with programming, and occasionally have guest speakers from industry. I found the society online and thought it would be great to get the BBC more involved in the local university happenings.&#xA;It is the first outreach project that I have undertaken, and it required a lot of preparation.</description>
