      <description>I like to dabble in making and playing music. Here is the equipment and setup that I use.&#xA;Ableton Live Intro&#xA;This is the DAW I use. I have been using Ableton Live for several years now, and I know my way around it. I have tried others but they never really felt as comfortable. Live comes in three flavours, &amp;lsquo;Intro&amp;rsquo; is the most basic paid-for version. I was surprised how cheap the &amp;lsquo;Intro&amp;rsquo; version was, and how little I find myself needing the features of the more expensive versions.</description>
