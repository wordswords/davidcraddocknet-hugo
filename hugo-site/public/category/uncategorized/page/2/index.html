    <p>Ever since I worked at an internet marketing company on an advertising analytics platform, I have realised that I don’t want my personal internet browsing tracked, monetised, influenced, and sold to the highest bidder. These are the steps that I have taken to reduce (you can never totally eliminate) this process.
Pi-Hole DNS This is a DNS server installed on a Raspberry Pi on my local home network. I have all the internet traffic going through my Virgin Media router filtered through this DNS server. It has many privacy-boosting features, but its main claim to fame is that it blocks the vast majority of internet advertising and analytics traffic on the DNS level. It currently blocks 20% of the requests made, which results in approximately 20% faster internet for me, and a lot more privacy/less tracking/less adverts.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">My Simple Commandline Git Workflow
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This is a simple description of how I work 99% of the time, as I am a simpleton. Origin/main is the new origin/master for future repositories, I just note both here for completeness because I use origin master for a lot of current repos.
I first make sure I am uptodate on origin/master or origin/main by git pulling. git checkout origin master git pull origin master I start making changes to the local copy on my local machine. When it gets to a point where I want to save my changes, I: git stash push git checkout -b &lt;branch name which will be made into a PR&gt; git stash pop I then commit the changes to the new branch. git commit When I am ready to create the PR, I create and push to the remote branch: git push origin &lt;branch name which will be made into a PR&gt; Github will tell me if master/main has diverged past a state where my commits can be merged in without conflict. If there is a possible conflict, I will merge in origin master/main to my local copy and then push to the PR branch again: git checkout &lt;branch name which will be made into a PR&gt; git pull origin master (or origin main) I resolve locally conflicts through git mergetool which, for me, is vim’s three way diff tool. I commit the updated conflicts and push to the remote branch - git add &amp;&amp; git commit &amp;&amp; git push origin &lt;branch name which will be made into a PR&gt; Often at this point I find I have to add new commits to fix things I have broken or have been flagged up in PR review. git commit git push origin &lt;branch name which will be made into a PR&gt; Reviewers now have some of their comments made on stale commits in Github. This is better than squashing the commits I find because sometimes the commits are not stale and their comments are still valid, and it becomes easier to keep track of. They can view the ‘files changed’ tab to add review comments until they are happy. I loop back to check whether master/main has diverged, and if it hasn’t just keep adding commits to address their concerns. The PR gets approved (hopefully) I merge the PR into master or main I delete the old branch </p>

    <p>After the last post I have added Ableton Live and my Eurorack modular to my DJ setup, with a master clock being sent via MIDI cables from my Roland TR8 drum machine that syncs with Ableton. The drum machine also can be used creatively for drum fills etc.
I hope these two diagrams explain my setup adequately - sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words! The ‘actor’ is me - I just couldn’t find a way to change that on http://draw.io :)

    <p> The classic!
Yes! Some people actually write and read BOOKS on DJing. As if YouTube wasn’t enough. Well it can be enough.. but YouTube is also a cess pit of rubbish information, and at least a book has a better chance of being properly edited and reviewed. Also reading a book makes you more intellectual. Which is utterly true.
So. I have been reading through these DJing books to see if they could teach me something I didn’t know about DJing after over 10 years doing it. And there were quite a few interesting techniques and tricks that I learned from these.

    <p>Journalism has deteriorated to a huge degree in the online age. A lot of articles and video content are one-sided short ‘clickbait’ – short messages designed to trigger an extreme emotional reaction. ALMOST ALL journalism is like this these days, it doesn’t matter if you have a highly established news network you have been trusting for decades, they have all had to adopt this low-quality strategy due to the ultra-competitive and dire financial situation that all news reporting finds itself in. However a lot of people still take news content at complete face value, and this leads to a huge number of people being misled about the real facts.

    <p> The three sections Left 9U section Right 9U section Middle 9U section So.. finally my 27U Eurorack modular synthesiser is complete. I have filled up the third - and surely last, as there is no more room in the studio! - case. I started this Eurorack modular in 2015.. so I am glad it is all complete now. I put in a small amount nearly every month for new modules. I am not some ‘rich kid’ who could afford to buy everything at once - and indeed I think my gradual approach has benefitted the overall modular because it’s made me think about what I actually need, and given me time to learn as I go along.

It runs the games she wants to play, the most graphically intensive being Deadpool, but it will also cope with Borderlands 2, Skyrim Special Edition, Shadow Warrior 2, and others.
