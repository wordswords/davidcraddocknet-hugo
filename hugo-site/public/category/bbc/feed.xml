      <description>2015 Update: The &amp;ldquo;Device Hive&amp;rdquo; project has now been changed to be called &amp;lsquo;Hive CI&amp;rsquo; and it is being maintained by a team of developers at the BBC, which I am no longer a part of. It is in the process of being opensourced, see: http://bbc.github.io/hive-ci/
