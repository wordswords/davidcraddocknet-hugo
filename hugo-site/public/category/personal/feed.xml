      <description>&lt;p&gt;NOTE: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.davidcraddock.net/2015/09/01/goals-for-the-year-2015-midway-update/&#34;&gt;I have an update on my progress as of 9/1/2015 here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivated by my good friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://cheeruplove.com/&#34;&gt;CheerUpLove.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s reflective style of blogging, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cubicgarden.com&#34;&gt;Ian Forrester&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s many interesting posts, I thought it would be interesting to post something a bit more personal and less technical on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that 2015 is upon us, I am going to take some time to publicly outline my goals for the year, so I can hold myself more accountable to them, and so I can look back on them this time next year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Motivated by my good friend <a href="http://cheeruplove.com/">CheerUpLove.com</a>&rsquo;s reflective style of blogging, and <a href="http://cubicgarden.com">Ian Forrester</a>&rsquo;s many interesting posts, I thought it would be interesting to post something a bit more personal and less technical on this blog.</p>
<p>Now that 2015 is upon us, I am going to take some time to publicly outline my goals for the year, so I can hold myself more accountable to them, and so I can look back on them this time next year.</p>
<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>
<p>One of my most important goals at the moment is to settle into my new role at the BBC as Test Manager. It is a step up for me, and I want to prove my stripes. I also will be pushing for a place to be opened up with Platform Test to employ someone from the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/careers/trainee-schemes-and-apprenticeships/extend/extend" title="Extend Scheme">Extend Scheme</a>.
<strong>What Success Will Look Like :</strong> Growing my team, Extendee placement, good performance reviews.</p>
<h3 id="creative-goals">Creative Goals</h3>
<p>I have been improving my music production skills a great deal over the past year, a pastime that I find very rewarding. I have also started piano lessons, which I aim to continue with. I aim to continue getting better, and maybe to look into another evening music course - perhaps the Game Audio course at Futureworks Manchester.
<strong>What Success Will Look Like :</strong> Improved music posted to Soundcloud, collaborations with other musicians, better ability at piano</p>
<h3 id="social-goals">Social Goals</h3>
<p>Getting married is going to be the main point of the year for me, with the wedding coming in September. Lots of preparing to do. I also want to keep the good friendships that I have at the moment, but perhaps make some new friends, particularly those who are into the same interests as me
<strong>What Success Will Look Like :</strong> Becoming Mr. Lewin, making friends with more people that are interested in the same things as I am</p>
<h3 id="financial-goals">Financial Goals</h3>
<p>I need to be saving more over the course of the year. I also want to join the BBC pension scheme, as I don&rsquo;t really have a pension yet
<strong>What Success Will Look Like :</strong> Significant savings at the end of the year, joining the pension scheme</p>
<h3 id="health-goals">Health Goals</h3>
<p>My fitness is something I need to become more serious about. I enjoy long-distance indoor rowing for stamina and fitness. I would like to do more of this, and there is a gym just down my road, so there isn&rsquo;t much excuse for me not to.
<strong>What Success Will Look Like :</strong> Adopt a regular form of keeping fit</p>
<p>So.. I will look back on this post through the year and hopefully it will motivate me to achieve these goals. Currently I think these goals are achievable, and I think 2015 will be a great year.</p>
