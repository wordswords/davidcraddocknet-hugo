      <description>I use and recommend the following software for Windows. They&amp;rsquo;re all quite easy to use. The paid software all have lifetime subscriptions, which are worth it because you need the latest updates in this area.
Aiseesoft Blu-ray Player: (for playing Blu-Rays) (paid) https://www.aiseesoft.com/blu-ray-player/
Easyfab Lossless Copy: (for ripping Blu-Rays, also works for DVDs) (paid) https://www.easefab.com/losslesscopy/
VLC: (for playing ripped copies) (free) https://www.videolan.org/
Handbrake: (for converting between different video formats and compressing video) (free) https://handbrake.</description>

<p>FFMPEG: (for splitting ripped video files, for TV series episodes) (free)
<a href="https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/">https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/</a></p>
<p>For using FFMPEG to split a ripped bluray track into episode segments, I look up the series on <a href="https://thetvdb.com">https://thetvdb.com</a> which has fairly accurate epsiode runtimes, and then for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span> ffmpeg.exe -i &#39;.\Samurai Jack Season 1_001.mp4&#39; -acodec copy -vcodec copy -ss 01:11:43 -t 00:23:00 samurai_jack_s01e04.mp4
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>.\Samurai Jack Season 1_001.mp4 is the source file</li>
<li>01:11:43 is the start time</li>
<li>00:23:00 is the duration</li>
<li>samurai_jack_s01e04.mp4 - is the destination file. I use Plex Media Server prefered titling for TV series, e.g. this is Series 1 Episode 4. This makes it easy to import with Plex.</li>
</ul>
<p>I then test the episode in VLC by looking at the start and end of the file to make sure the split is correct, and adjusting the start/end times and re-running as appropriate.</p>
