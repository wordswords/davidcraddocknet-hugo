      <description>Nagios can be seen as a automated test tool for systems, just as you would have automated tests for software projects. In test driven development (TDD), you write the tests first, and then use those tests to build up a software project that you can have confidence that it works. We can use this method to build up systems, or networks of systems. Plan out which services and processes should be running on your new systems, and then implement Nagios tests for every one.</description>

We can use this method to build up systems, or networks of systems. Plan out which services and processes should be running on your new systems, and then implement Nagios tests for every one. You can check the progress of your build by checking Nagios. I have been doing this at the BBC. It is a simple idea but one that seems to work.</p>

      <description>As a break from my contract work, I took the W3Schools PHP Certification. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any revision, which probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t wise. It was a bit more difficult than I thought, but I passed still.</description>

      <description>Volunteers on the OLPC project have developed a low-cost heart rate monitor that can be plugged into the XO laptop, making steps towards an affordable monitoring system for hospitals in developing countries.
For more information on the development, see the: OLPC Goldenstate project. People in the US can currently buy the sensor here; unfortunately there is no international shipping yet in place.</description>

      <description>If you use Google calendar, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got an iPhone, or Windows Mobile phone like me, then you&amp;rsquo;ll be pleased to hear about the new Google Sync for Mobile tool just brought out into beta by Google. There were various ways to sync Google Calender events to Windows Mobile devices before, but nothing officially supported. Google uses an ActiveSync server to push the events to your phone, making things a lot easier.</description>

<p>Google Sync for Mobile is available for most mobile phones. On iPhone, Blackberry and Windows Mobile devices Google Sync enables over-the-air synchronization of Google Calendar and Google Contacts to the built-in Calendar and Address Book applications on your phone.

      <description>I did something out of the ordinary this Christmas. I bought an &amp;ldquo;XO&amp;rdquo; laptop for a child in a third world country. I also bought an XO laptop for myself, so I can develop software designed to be distributed to the 1 million+ XO laptops out there in the third world.
The laptop runs a Linux operating system, with an special interface programmed almost exclusively in Python. Most apps, called &amp;lsquo;activities&amp;rsquo;, run as python programs.</description>

<p>The laptop runs a Linux operating system, with an special interface programmed almost exclusively in Python. Most apps, called &lsquo;activities&rsquo;, run as python programs. This is ideal for me, as I enjoy hacking around in python, and Linux is - of course - very familiar to me.</p>
<p>I hope to use the laptop to contribute to health informatics applications that allow the laptop to be used in hospitals where there are no existing comparable health systems. If you wish to get involved in this project and give something back, here in the UK you can now order your own laptop <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/One-Laptop-Per-Child-XO/dp/B001LDQWJI">from Amazon.co.uk</a>.</p>

      <description>This is so cool.. Google are beta-testing a totally free hosting and cloud-computing resource called Google App Engine. The caveat is that your hosted app must be written in Python. Python is amazing anyway, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t know it, now is the perfect time to learn. Check this out for more information about Google App Engine:
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/whatisgoogleappengine.html
They&amp;rsquo;re giving away a very generous 500MB disk space and enough processing power to serve 5 million pages a month.</description>

      <description>The Stanford engineering department, often regarded as the best in the world for computer science education, has made its core CS curriculum free for anyone with an internet connection. There are some catches, ie: you don&amp;rsquo;t get your assignments marked, you have no contact with the lecturer, but all the same, it is really a great resource. The material is very high-quality, professionally filmed lectures and a full compliment of handouts and course notes.</description>

It also does not even assume knowledge of programming - it teaches you right from the basics.</p>

      <description>I passed the adExcellence exam first time.. woo! It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that difficult really.
&amp;ldquo;David Craddock of iCrossing is accredited as an official Microsoft adExcellence Member. A Microsoft adExcellence Member has completed comprehensive online training on managing Microsoft adCenter search engine marketing campaigns and has demonstrated expert knowledge by passing the Microsoft adExcellence accreditation exam.&amp;rdquo;
As of 21/3/08, I&amp;rsquo;m somehow also now #1 on Google.co.uk for the keyword &amp;ldquo;adExcellence exam&amp;rdquo;.. if that&amp;rsquo;s what you googled for, you probably want the adExcellence main site instead.</description>

      <description>I have just seen Yahoo! Pipes, and am convinced this is going to change the web. For real.
Data source sites will become &amp;lsquo;content providers&amp;rsquo;, data will be aggregated and filtered from multiple content providers, either by the user or by &amp;lsquo;intermediary&amp;rsquo; sites. The user will be able to choose his &amp;lsquo;data view&amp;rsquo; of the content on the internet, just as Google is currently doing.
This is fascinating stuff if you&amp;rsquo;re involved in the web industry.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s still developing, but it looks quite good, and we&amp;rsquo;re ready to start showing it off to people. So check it out!
UPDATE: This project is now defunct after running for several years, and is no longer hosted. But thanks for the interest!

See: http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampBrighton2 and http://www.barcampbrighton.org/ for more info.
Update: Brighton Barcamp 2 is now over.
This was really interesting, and I learned a huge amount in a very short amount of time. Thanks to everyone who talked to me. I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be attending future Barcamps.</description>

      <description>I just noticed that US bulletinboard giant Craigslist.com has opened a Brighton UK section of their website! There are a few posts already. At the moment, Gumtree&amp;rsquo;s Brighton Section is massively popular here. I&amp;rsquo;ve recurited several flatmates using Gumtree, and am basing my local housing search around it.
It will be interesting to see how Gumtree.com fares now that Craigslist.com has competition in the Brighton local area.</description>

      <description>This blog will be about my perspective on technology. Anything that catches my interest will be fair game, but mainly it will revolve around internet technology and the development of such.
It will allow me to create an online presence, and to improve my writing skills.
I hope you will find the time to check back on this blog and watch it progress.</description>
