      <description>A few months ago I switched across from Bash onto the Fish shell, on my main development machine. I can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of its fast autosuggestions and its sane scripting language. Compared to Bash it is very fun to use.
Today I wrote a script to automate the backup of my development workspace onto a private bitbucket account. Bitbucket is good because it allows unlimited private repositories, but it caps the size of these repos at 2GB max, with some features disabled after 1GB.</description>
