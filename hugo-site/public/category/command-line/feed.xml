      <description>To quickly find large files to delete if you have filled your startup disk, enter this command on the OSX terminal:
sudo find / -size +500000 -print This will find and print out file paths to files over 500MB. You can then go through them and delete them individually by typing rm &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;, although there is no undelete so make sure you know you won&amp;rsquo;t miss them.</description>
