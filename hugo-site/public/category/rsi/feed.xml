      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had noticed I&amp;rsquo;d been having quite bad problems with my fingers based on the fact that I had been scrolling the mouse wheel too much when scrolling through web pages. Here are a number of options you can take if you are in a similar situation as me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;change-oss-scrolling-speed-to-its-maximum&#34;&gt;Change OS&amp;rsquo;s scrolling speed to its maximum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the easiest change on most modern OSs, and will result in less scroll movements made by your fingers, because each scroll movement will move the screen down by a full screen height, (equivalent to a page down). This can be a bit annoying though as you lose accuracy when you want to just scroll down a small amount, it takes a bit of getting used to. Also you are still using the same muscles, just not as often.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
