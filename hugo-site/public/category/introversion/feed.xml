&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you agree with Myers-Briggs personality profiling or not, like fellow BBC&amp;rsquo;er &lt;a href=&#34;http://cubicgarden.com/2015/07/27/being-entp-dyslexic-and-relationships/&#34;&gt;Ian Forrester&lt;/a&gt; I have found them a useful frame of reference from which to discuss my personality, because I see similarities between my perception of me, and the classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the Myers-Briggs personality profiling, and it has labelled me on several occasions an INTP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INTPs are marked by a quiet, stoic, modest, and aloof exterior that masks strong creativity and enthusiasm for novel possibilities. Their weaknesses include poor organization, insensitivity to social niceties, and a tendency to get lost in abstractions. Keirsey referred to INTPs as Architects, one of the four types belonging to the temperament he called the Rationals
&amp;hellip;
I â€“ Introversion preferred to extraversion: INTPs tend to be quiet and reserved. They generally prefer interacting with a few close friends rather than a wide circle of acquaintances, and they expend energy in social situations (whereas extraverts gain energy).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
