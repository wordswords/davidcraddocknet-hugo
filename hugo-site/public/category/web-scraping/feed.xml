      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of writing a web scraper for the forums on Gaia Online. Previously, I used to use Python to develop web scrapers, with the very handy Python library BeautifulSoup. Java has an equivalent called JSoup.&#xA;Here I have written a class which is extended by each class in my project that wants to scrape HTML. This &amp;lsquo;Scraper&amp;rsquo; class deals with the fetching of the HTML and converting it into a JSoup tree to be navigated and have the data picked out of.</description>

      <description>I am moving to Manchester soon, and so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d get an idea of the housing market there by scraping all the Manchester Gumtree property adverts into a MySQL database. Once in the database, I could do things like find the average monthly price for a 2 bedroom flat in an area, and spot bargains through using standard deviation from the mean on the price through using simple SQL queries via phpMyAdmin.</description>
