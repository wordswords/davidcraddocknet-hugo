      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.davidcraddock.net/my-computer-setup/&#34;&gt;As you can see&lt;/a&gt;, I buy a lot of bits and pieces for my PC. Occasionally though, I buy something that I feel was a disappointment, or not worth the investment. This post is meant to caution against other people making the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;razer-tiamat---71-surround-sound-gaming-headset-with-microphone-httpwwwrazerzonecomhttpwwwrazerzonecom&#34;&gt;Razer Tiamat - 7.1 Surround Sound Gaming Headset, with microphone &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.razerzone.com&#34;&gt;(http://www.razerzone.com)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a big dissapointment in a couple of ways. The first, and most obvious in hindsight now I&amp;rsquo;m actually working on spatial audio for a living at BBC R&amp;amp;D, is that 7.1 surround sound headsets are a joke. There is no way you can get enough seperation between the different speaker drivers when your ears are so close to the speakers. If you have a soundcard or motherboard that supports surround sound, do yourself a favour and get a surround sound speaker set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
