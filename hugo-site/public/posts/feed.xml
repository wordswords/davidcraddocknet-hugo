      <description>I have moved over from wordpress.com that I was using before on DavidCraddock.net to self-hosting using Python&amp;rsquo;s Hugo.
I hope this will be a good move!
A bit of content didn&amp;rsquo;t make it, but most of it, thankfully, did.
I will continue to tidy up bits and pieces as I go along.</description>

      <title>Advice to young people in the UK wanting a career in Tech</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2024/04/23/4683/</link>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re currently in high school in the UK and want to be a GOOD and EMPLOYED software engineer.. this is my advice.
Start programming on personal projects right away, and keep it up during your entire working career. Always have something going on in the background. Get into a RUSSELL GROUP university in the UK and take a technical, demanding degree in a computing-related discipline, for example, Physics, Electronic Engineering, Maths, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re currently in high school in the UK and want to be a GOOD and EMPLOYED software engineer.. this is my advice.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start programming on personal projects right away, and keep it up during your entire working career. Always have something going on in the background.</li>
<li>Get into a <a href="https://russellgroup.ac.uk/about/our-universities/">RUSSELL GROUP</a> university in the UK and take a technical, demanding degree in a computing-related discipline, for example, Physics, Electronic Engineering, Maths, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence. If you can&rsquo;t get into a university and course that isn&rsquo;t in the top 25% of courses for your subject in the UK, and someone isn&rsquo;t paying all your bills (e.g rich parents), don&rsquo;t bother going to university, It&rsquo;s not worth the loan. Find another way. Look into apprenticeships.</li>
<li>Try to not be a total &rsquo;tech head&rsquo; and develop some creative and artistic side to you, taking up writing is a really good idea as it improves your thinking and communication skills. Ideally learn to write humanities essays to the standard of the first year humanities majors at your university.</li>
<li>Try and get onto as many technical internships and technical work experience as possible throughout your degree.</li>
<li>Once you have graduated, and found that the Junior tech worker job market is depressingly non-existant, move back in with your parents and start your informal and free &lsquo;post-graduate&rsquo; learning. Take AT LEAST <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">this free course</a> but also certifications such as AWS certs, and anything that you have researched on Reddit etc that you can do cheaply and is sought after by your chosen target job (as evidenced by being mentioned on job descriptions of jobs you&rsquo;d like to apply for). Increase your work on your personal projects and move to open source them and build up a following from them, and possibly a side-income. Keep in contact with your old uni friends, especially the ones that have got jobs.</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you">&lsquo;So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore You&rsquo; by Cal Newport</a>, learn to market yourself, build your LinkedIn presence, network like crazy, and hopefully you will get your foot in the door with that &lsquo;all important&rsquo; first job that you can launch a career off of. You&rsquo;ll certainly deserve it.</li>

      <title>Music Acquisition Process for DJ Music</title>

      <description>My music acquisition process for DJ music:
ARM (Automatic Ripping Machine) rips CDs I buy into FLAC form without any interactivity. You just insert a CD into the Linux server, and then it ejects it when it&amp;rsquo;s done. Lidarr downloads FLACs of any tracks of artists I have in my collection, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have their full discography. It does this automatically and silently in the background. Once a day, a cron job imports ARM and Lidarr downloads into my Beets.</description>

<li>Lidarr downloads FLACs of any tracks of artists I have in my collection, but I don&rsquo;t have their full discography. It does this automatically and silently in the background.</li>
<li>Once a day, a cron job imports ARM and Lidarr downloads into my Beets.io music library, and deals with file integrity checks, tagging, metadata, library file structure and embedded images of the artist.</li>
<li>Whenever I&rsquo;m ready to have a fresh library copy, I run my batch script on my W11 DJ laptop and it robocopy mirrors the entire library from my Linux samba share onto my computer.</li>
<li>I then send it through MixedInKey 10 to analyse the BPM and the music key of each track, and to check again the integrity of each file.</li>
<li>Once that is done, and any corrupt files removed, I import the file library into Serato DJ Pro, and analyse the entire collection. This again removes any dud files from the collection.</li>
<li>Now I have a complete music library, I run a batch file to reverse mirror the music from the DJ library back onto the server, so my collection doesn&rsquo;t accumalate corrupt files.</li>
<li>Now I have a full DJ music library of FLACs on my DJ laptop, over 22,000 files, great for requests!</li>

      <title>Retrospective for 2023</title>

      <description>Every year towards the end of the year, I put together a retrospective of events that have happened over the year - the good, bad and the ugly.
The Bad Most of the year was taken up with treatment for relapsed Hodgkins Lymphoma cancer. After the clinical immunotherapy drug trial finished in Feb 2023, cancer was unfortunately still detected, so it did not completely cure it. I had a further (awful) spell in hospital around March/April where my Hickman line became infected and I had a severe mental health episode, probably caused by the strong antibiotics being pumped through my system.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year towards the end of the year, I put together a retrospective of events that have happened over the year - the good, bad and the ugly.</p>
<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most of the year was taken up with treatment for relapsed Hodgkins Lymphoma cancer. After the clinical immunotherapy drug trial finished in Feb 2023, cancer was unfortunately still detected, so it did not completely cure it. I had a further (awful) spell in hospital around March/April where my Hickman line became infected and I had a severe mental health episode, probably caused by the strong antibiotics being pumped through my system. Finally I was accepted for a stem cell transplant, and had my transplant on 4th July.</li>
<li>We have had to deal with complications of cancer elsewhere in the family, not just my mum&rsquo;s own cancer treatment being ongoing, but the financial impact of the family having to support both of us, is quite a significant burden.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thankfully, I&rsquo;m finally in remission for cancer! I have been in remission for 6 months, and if I make it to 2 years, then I am effectively cured. I have a 75% chance of it not coming back within that time, approximately.</li>
<li>We got an absolute ton of stuff done on the house, and I have an awesome gaming setup, an awesome DJing setup, an awesome music production setup, an awesome high speed network and server setup, and an awesome WFH setup. All of the goals I set myself of things I wanted to achieve during my downtime having cancer treatment nearly 2 years ago, are more or less finished now.</li>
<li>We have decided that we&rsquo;re moving out of Manchester. We are going to move to Chester, which promises a much, much nicer, quieter, and actually, cheaper place to live now that I am committed to a 100% WFH work life. Things are progressing well with the house sale, and we&rsquo;ve got a lot of interest so far.</li>
<li>I have got fitter and healthier and my posture has got better over the year. I have also managed to reduce the medication I am on, which has helped my health.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>There has been a worldwide downturn for software jobs, just as I had to take some time off my career due to work reasons. This downturn is probably comparable to the 2008/9 downturn in software jobs around the financial crisis. This is definitely bad news for everyone in software.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Latest Remote Guitar Lesson Setup</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2023/09/22/latest-remote-guitar-lesson-setup/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been having online guitar lessons with my friend Jon.
After a while we have got things down to a setup that seems to work remotely.
I have an Epiphone Les Paul Vintage Edition electric guitar, and a Marshall MG15G Practice Amp. I use a headphone splitter cable to plug into the Marshall&amp;rsquo;s headphone out socket, which splits the audio into left and right channels, and a 3.5mm to phono mono cable plugged into the headphone splitter that runs to my audio interface.</description>

<p>After a while we have got things down to a setup that seems to work remotely.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have an Epiphone Les Paul Vintage Edition electric guitar, and a Marshall MG15G Practice Amp.</li>
<li>I use a headphone splitter cable to plug into the Marshall&rsquo;s headphone out socket, which splits the audio into left and right channels, and a 3.5mm to phono mono cable plugged into the headphone splitter that runs to my audio interface.</li>
<li>I use Logitech C270 and a Logitech 920 cameras, the C270 for the front on face cam, and the 920 suspended on a lighting boom above my head, pointed down so that Jon can see the guitar fret fingering I am attempting.</li>
<li>I also use a t.bone MB88U directional microphone on a desk microphone stand to talk into.</li>
<li>The sound interface I use is my studio one, which is a Behringer UMC1820 audio interface, but really, you can use any audio interface with two mono input channels and a headphone monitor.</li>
<li>I have a KORG CA-2 portable tuner which helps me get the guitar in tune before each session.</li>
<li>I use a WINGO Guitar Capo and plectrums as well.</li>
<li>We use Zoom to do the lessons over, Jon has a subscription, and Skype to store notes between sessions.</li>
<li>I use my phone to take pictures of my fret fingering to practice.</li>
<li>I have a portable flask that I keep with me if I need to take a drink during the session, as to not disrupt things.</li>
<li>I always tune the guitar before the session as to not waste time.</li>
<li>I always switch my audio speakers off, and use headphones on the audio interface, to minimise disturbance to others, and to stop feedback.</li>
<li>I have a pen and paper to make any notes needed on the session. This saves time compared to typing them into the computer.</li>
<li>The sessions are 45mins -&gt; 1 hour max, weekly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zoom-setup">Zoom Setup</h3>
<p>This is the Zoom configuration options that I use. Currently I do not turn on the &lsquo;original audio for musicians&rsquo; toggle when on the call:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_165149.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_165149.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_165150.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_165150.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_165155.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_165155.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a></p>
<h4 id="advanced-settings">Advanced Settings</h4>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_165202.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_165202.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a></p>
<h3 id="audio-setup">Audio Setup</h3>
<p>These are the settings I use on my guitar interface and the Marshall amp for optimium sound.</p>
<p>The left channel (purple cable) is the microphone, and right is the guitar amp.</p>
<p>Both volumes are set to max.</p>
<p>Pad and instrument (phono) are both ON on the microphone channel, and both OFF on the guitar amp channel.</p>
<p>I also have &lsquo;Stereo audio&rsquo; setup on the sound interface, and &lsquo;Mono Audio&rsquo; setup on the windows sound settings, so it combines both channels into one.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_163710.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_163710.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_163702.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_163702.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_180318.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230922_180318.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a></p>
<p>On the guitar, the switch is set to &rsquo;treble&rsquo;, the volume set to 10, and the distortion set to 0.</p>
<h3 id="video-setup">Video Setup</h3>
<h4 id="front-on-cam">Front on Cam</h4>
<p>This is a small face-on camera that sits on the top of my monitor for showing my face on the call. It is a Logitech C270 camera and does not have a wide range of view.</p>
<p>It can be plugged into my USB hub with no problem usually.</p>
<p>It should be centered and the monitor lowered so that my face is in full view.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230802_165303.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230802_165303.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230802_170213.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230802_170213.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230802_170154.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230802_170154.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a></p>
<h4 id="top-down-cam">Top down Cam</h4>
<p>This is a wide angle logitech C920 that I use for showing the fingering and technique when I am playing guitar. I have it on a lighting boom which I also use for my DJ streaming setup so it is quite easy to move around.</p>
<p>It should be plugged directly into the laptop I&rsquo;m using for the call as the USB hub and USB KVM does not have enough additional bandwidth to handle it. I have a USB 3 extension cable for it.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230802_170521.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230802_170521.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230802_170132.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230802_170132.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230802_170137.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230802_170137.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a></p>
<p>I use my Lumie Brazil S.A.D. lamp to flood my room with white light to improve the visuals for the camera, but really any bright white light source (not yellow) would achieve this.</p>

      <title>Optical Drive Cleaners and Home Entertainment Test Tools</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2023/02/23/optical-drive-cleaners-and-home-entertainment-test-tools/</link>

      <description>If you are still using optical discs, e.g. CDs or Blu-rays, in music, video or games, then you are in the minority these days. Downloads and streaming have become the norm, which means 1) A lot less discs are being produced 2) A lot less optical drives are being produced.
Because a lot less optical drives are being produced, we can imagine a time in the future when the only optical drives you can buy, are second-hand.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are still using optical discs, e.g. CDs or Blu-rays, in music, video or games, then you are in the minority these days. Downloads and streaming have become the norm, which means 1) A lot less discs are being produced 2) A lot less optical drives are being produced.</p>
<p>Because a lot less optical drives are being produced, we can imagine a time in the future when the only optical drives you can buy, are second-hand. Regardless if you can buy new optical drives currently or not, often the best value/quality ratio can be found in second-hand optical drives.</p>
<p>But, the problem with second-hand optical drives is that they often have been heavily used, and are dirty. This is where optical drive cleaners come in.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a 5.1 surround system, or a complex audio/video sound setup of any type, then you can benefit from the tests and tools included on these discs. I found, for example, that even on my 2.0 stereo setup, my system was &lsquo;out of phase&rsquo; when using my CD cleaner, and figuring that out REALLY helped the quality of my sound setup!</p>
<p>So yes, they are a good thing to have, and they are quite cheap, compared to the cost of buying a brand new optical drive anyway, or a new sound system!</p>
<p>These are the ones I use:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20230223_094304.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20230223_094304.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a></p>
<p>I use Allsop&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prolens Laser Lens Cleaner&rdquo; for CD players, and DigitalInnovation&rsquo;s &ldquo;Clean DR Laser Lens Cleaner&rdquo; for Blu-ray drives, DVD drives, and games consoles with those. They work great, and have already fixed an old CD player that wouldn&rsquo;t work, and also fixed my second-hand PS4 which wouldn&rsquo;t play Blu-ray games.</p>

      <description>Every year (when I remember) I do an end-of-year summary to outline what has been going on in my life. I’ve been doing this for a few years now, and it’s a great way to look back on the year and see has happened.
The Bad: The main bad news of the year is that, contrary to expectations, my Hodgkins Lymphoma cancer was detected again around April after the initial chemotherapy.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year (when I remember) I do an end-of-year summary to outline what has been going on in my life. I’ve been doing this for a few years now, and it’s a great way to look back on the year and see has happened.</p>
<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The main bad news of the year is that, contrary to expectations, my Hodgkins Lymphoma cancer was detected again around April after the initial chemotherapy. So it had come back.</li>
<li>The rest of the year has mostly revolved around subsequent treatments to try and reach a long term remission, e.g. cure. I&rsquo;m not there yet, but there are a lot of treatments still available, and I have hope that my current immunotherapy treatment might be the one that works.</li>
<li>It wasn&rsquo;t just me that was affected, my wife suffered quite a bit on hearing the news, and has only just really taken it all in and come to terms with it.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that I will be cured eventually, at least for a good 10-20 years or so, it just is a pain having to take time off work and go through sometimes intensive treatment sessions.</li>
<li>The economy has not had the greatest of years either, and the cost of living crisis affecting the UK has had an effect on us, and my parents who are the main financial support we have while I am unable to work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-good">The Good:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have found a renewed interest in my career, in software development, and I have spent a lot of my spare time, and part of my downtime for treatment, learning new technical things and just generally finding the enjoyment in technology that I thought I&rsquo;d permanently lost for so many years.</li>
<li>The career opportunities around working from home have been very good considering my illness. There is still, despite a downturn, more than enough work around, and a lot of it is 100% work from home work. I&rsquo;m no longer worried about being unemployed for any great length of time, presuming I am healthy enough to work from home.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been developing my writing and social media skills, which have been a welcome distraction from the bad stuff going on. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed writing, but I would say my writing has particularly improved over the past year.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="work-on-the-house">Work on the house</h4>
<p>We have spent a lot of time, effort and money on working on the house this year. Conny has put in a great deal of amazing work, in particular.</p>
<h5 id="the-back-garden">The Back Garden</h5>
<p>This has been transformed, from a jungle into a really nice space to relax. It is very relaxing to sit under the gazebo and get my 15-30 minutes of sun per day when I am working from home. There are always birds throughout the year around the garden, and the sound of birds tweeting away is great to listen to when you&rsquo;re stressed.</p>
<h5 id="the-music-studio--games-room">The Music Studio / Games room</h5>
<p>We have done a lot to the Music Studio, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Putting in a huge 5x5 IKEA KALLAX to store all the records and books.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replacing the old 1970s desk I had from when I was 18, with a more comfortable large IKEA desk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of updates to the DJ setup, including using my Vestax VCM-600 as a Resolume controller, and putting up a DJ screen around the DJ booth. Also, I got a new top-down high quality camera for the decks, which is very useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a mini table in the studio which is big enough to share a meal together and sit and have a drink together, as we did at Xmas and new years. We are going to try and eat together at this table every Sunday, in the German tradition.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="the-study">The Study</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This has been completely changed, with an IKEA motorized standing desk and tons of new stuff. I have built the ideal setup for me for working from home. We also have sorted out bookshelves for books and CDs, and organized them all. Conny also has a little desk and area for her gaming PC, so we can game together / hang out together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a standing electric clothes dryer, which has been very useful as it can dry an entire washing machines load in 4 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To keep an eye on the air quality because of the new dryer, we have an air filter in the study, and an air quality sensor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="the-home-network-and-thinkstation-server">The Home Network and ThinkStation Server</h5>
<p>This has been completely redone.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Currently we have not one but TWO gigabit internet connections, and a static IP address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a small fibre optic 10Gb/sec network between the ThinkStation server and my music studio computer. I hope to also add a 2.5Gb/sec link to my DJing laptop soon, so I can shunt files around superfast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ThinkStation server now runs Ubuntu instead of Windows, and serves up my Ebook collection, my music, TV and movies collection, and stores my console games too, which are accessed by my studio PC. It has about 10 TB of space which I am backing up fully to my Google Drive with Borg backup and rclone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Ubuntu ThinkStation and Linux development environment has seen a LOT of work. I have everything running very much to my liking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have mounted all network equipment possible on the walls, and used cable ties a lot to minimise mess.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="the-kitchen">The Kitchen</h5>
<p>We have a small counter-top dishwasher now, which works very well, and is very helpful in reducing the amount of housework necessary.</p>
<h3 id="the-ugly">The Ugly:</h3>
<ul>
<li>No ugly things have really happened, touch wood!</li>
</ul>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I hope everyone has a good Xmas involving a lot of mince pies, liquid refreshments, and good times.</p>

      <title>Tips for Working from Home</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2022/10/18/tips-for-working-from-home/</link>

      <description>I have been working from home, the majority of the time, for over 5 years. It took a lot of adjustment, and I&amp;rsquo;m still not 100% adjusted, but if you want to undertake this, then these are my tips.
Note that a big part of the benefit from working from home is the total flexibility in work environment, so these are only tips that work for me - they might not work for you!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been working from home, the majority of the time, for over 5 years. It took a lot of adjustment, and I&rsquo;m still not 100% adjusted, but if you want to undertake this, then these are my tips.</p>
<p>Note that a big part of the benefit from working from home is the total flexibility in work environment, so these are only tips that work for me - they might not work for you! However, I think there is probably quite a bit of commonality.</p>
<p><strong>1) Find some way of exercising</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly bad at this usually, but not due to lack of understanding! Lately my under-desk bike that allows me to work while cycling away, has been very beneficial. I also don&rsquo;t own a car, so this increases the amount of walking I do (if I don&rsquo;t get an Uber, that is).</p>
<p>Realistically, you probably want to adopt some kind of regular exercise routine that is out of the home, in order to get yourself out of the home and also exercising regularly. This is even more important now you work from home.</p>
<p><strong>2) Have a room for your study.</strong></p>
<p>I know this is difficult in a lot of situations, but really, if you are going to be working from home regularly over your career, you really need your own study area with a door that shuts. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a big room, just enough for your desk. It should of course have a window, my study has a south facing window which is great because I always get a window seat!</p>
<p><strong>3) Make your own lunch.</strong></p>
<p>There is still the temptation to get your own sandwiches delivered if you live in a big city like I do, but really you want to make the most of the huge savings you can make on your lunch every day, and make your own sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>4) Get enough sunlight.</strong></p>
<p>I am lucky enough to have a garden, but when you are working at home and living at home, you will almost definitely spend less time in the sunshine. I make an effort to spend 15 minutes in direct sunlight every day, to help vitamin D absorption and to combat the winter blues. You probably additionally want to be taking vitamin D supplements during the winter months as the NHS recommends for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>5) Make use of your freedom.</strong></p>
<p>Most employers I&rsquo;ve had will not care if you take a 30-minute nap during the day, as long as you don&rsquo;t miss any meetings. This gives you a huge advantage over keeping fresh and alert and doing your best work over office workers. They might be tired during the day, if you&rsquo;re tired, you can take a power nap. Make sure you don&rsquo;t abuse this privilege, and it will help you, and your employer, as the work you do will be of higher quality.</p>
<p><strong>6) Don&rsquo;t use your work computer for personal things.</strong></p>
<p>Not only is it unprofessional, and traceable by your employer, but you can easily keep a computing device near to you when you work from home to do all your personal stuff on.</p>
<p><strong>7) Customize your desk environment.</strong></p>
<p>I have a standing desk with a CD player, record player, a surround sound system, a personal computer, a fan, an ergonomic chair, and under desk bike, and a foot cushion to put my feet up when I want. I recommend NOT relying on your workplace to give you any money for your working from home environment, spend your own money, and don&rsquo;t skimp, see it as a long term investment. I also recommend getting an ergonomic keyboard and mouse, and a BIG screen - mine is a 32&quot; graphic designers monitor. Why not make your work environment as nice as possible, now you can?</p>
<p><strong>8) Have other places you occasionally work from.</strong></p>
<p>I can work from my garden during the summer months, I have a sheltered gazebo, an external waterproof plug socket, and an external network cable. Have other places you can work from, even if it means a coffee shop. That will improve your productivity if you feel yourself stuck in a rut.</p>
<p><strong>9) Don&rsquo;t get distracted.</strong></p>
<p>Remember you still have to DO the work! Actually you may have to work slightly harder in fact, because statistically remote workers are more judged on their productivity level than in the office. Things like pomodoro timers may help. I have a pomodoro timer, and also use my Amazon Echo Dot to set arbitrary quick alarms, so I can impose deadlines on myself to get things done. I also have a TODO list, that helps.</p>
<p><strong>10) Make sure you have friends to talk to.</strong></p>
<p>Working from home 100% can be a bit isolating, so I have friends external to work that I message during the day, some of whom also fully work from home. Do talk to your colleagues as well of course, but also have people you can call or message from time to time, just as you would have the odd quick chat in an office to your friends.</p>
<p>Also remember that pets are a lot more of a viable commitment now you work from home. Dogs can be very useful in particular, as they combine getting out of the house with companionship.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I hope these tips have helped you. I really couldn&rsquo;t go back to working in an office. Working from home full time is one of the best things that has happened to my career.</p>

      <title>The Current State of UK Politics</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2022/09/29/the-current-state-of-uk-politics/</link>

      <guid>http://davidcraddock.net/2022/09/29/the-current-state-of-uk-politics/</guid>
      <description>For years, UK politics has become more right-wing, popularist, and presidential.
Right-wing, because the Conservatives have been in power for over 10 years, and have had the opportunity to implement most of their ideological policies, which we see at the moment highlighted to an extreme with Liz Truss gearing up to emulate Thatcher on almost every level.
Popularist, because the Conservatives have implemented policies designed to appease the populations feelings, rather than those based on factual positive outcomes.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, UK politics has become more <strong>right-wing</strong>, <strong>popularist</strong>, and <strong>presidential</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Right-wing</strong>, because the Conservatives have been in power for over 10 years, and have had the opportunity to implement most of their ideological policies, which we see at the moment highlighted to an extreme with Liz Truss gearing up to emulate Thatcher on almost every level.</p>
<p><strong>Popularist</strong>, because the Conservatives have implemented policies designed to appease the populations feelings, rather than those based on factual positive outcomes.</p>
<p>The biggest example is Brexit. People voted for Brexit based on a mix of nationalism, xenophobia and racism. Lots of people were tired of the increasing multicultural nature of their communities and society, and wanted to make them &lsquo;British&rsquo; again, whatever that meant for them.</p>
<p>Of course, we see now that Brexit has cost the country billions and billions, and very much reduced our standing as a powerful nation in the world. The Conservatives knew this, of course, that is why so many of the Conservative politicians now trumpeting hot air about the positives of Brexit originally voted AGAINST Brexit, because they knew it was bad for the country.</p>
<p><strong>Presidential</strong>, because voters increasingly vote based on the personality of the would-be Prime Minister. They forget entirely about the policies that are part of their manifesto, presumably thinking they will not be implemented due to a general cynicism about politicians keeping their promises, which has worsened around Boris Johnson&rsquo;s behaviour as Prime Minster.</p>
<p>The problem with picking a leader based on personality, is that you are often misled about this personality by the press and media. Especially in a country with media and press which is controlled by the right-wing. They will paint whoever is the current Labour hopeful in an incredibly bad light, so much so that the public will not be able to rationally judge them on their personality. They will also paint the current Conservative leader in glowing colours, and try and brush under the carpet any problems, as much as possible.</p>
<p>This is not a conspiracy theory. I have seen the change at the BBC between 2011 and 2017 while I was there. Increasingly the leadership of the organisation was put under pressure to silence left-wing voices and programmes from within, and increase right-wing representation. When I left it was most definitely a Conservative-owned media giant, with an ex Conservative MP leading the organisation. Most people who regularly read the newspapers and watch TV don&rsquo;t even realise they are being influenced at all.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>What is the alternative then? Ignore the media. Pick a leader based on the policies they say they will implement. It&rsquo;s simple. The leader is just a figurehead at the end of the day, it is the whole party behind them that rules the country, and that party will have a set of policies it wants implementing and will publish them.</p>
<p>Simply read through their two manifestos on the different party websites, do the research on the issues around those policies on a relatively neutral website such as Wikipedia, and consider which would help you personally and people you care about the most.</p>
<p>But people don&rsquo;t do that. They just judge the leaders personalities based on what they read in click-bait articles, the newspapers and see on TV.</p>
<p>I would also recommend anyone consuming the news media on any level <a href="/2021/01/08/davids-guide-to-the-news/">read my article on it</a>.</p>

      <description>Here are some extra tips if you&amp;rsquo;re just getting started out on Ubuntu.
You don&amp;rsquo;t have to go through the UI to shut down or reboot your computer. You can do it from the command line. The commands are:
sudo reboot # to reboot sudo poweroff # to shut down and power off the computer You can get a lot more information on your computers startup and shutdown sequences by removing the default Ubuntu splash screen that obscures this.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are some extra tips if you&rsquo;re just getting started out on Ubuntu.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go through the UI to shut down or reboot your computer. You can do it from the command line. The commands are:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo reboot # to reboot
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo poweroff # to shut down and power off the computer
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>You can get a lot more information on your computers startup and shutdown sequences by removing the default Ubuntu splash screen that obscures this. You should definitely do this if you want to learn more about what your system is
actually doing under the hood, especially if you need to troubleshoot what it&rsquo;s doing. To do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-gdscript3" data-lang="gdscript3"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo nano <span style="color:#f92672">/</span>etc<span style="color:#f92672">/</span>grub<span style="color:#f92672">/</span>default<span style="color:#f92672">/</span>grub
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># find the line where it says GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and remove &#39;quiet splash&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># from this variable. If that leaves the variable empty make sure it is</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># still set as an empty variable, e.g. GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=&#34;&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo update<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>grub
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo reboot
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now you will see everything that is happening when your system starts up and
shuts down, or reboots.</p>

      <description>For 8 TB of data storage on Google Drive, plus my own Google organization, I am paying £30/month, which is a pretty good deal.
I wanted to use this space for backing up my NAS, but it was proving difficult. The program I was recommended for Linux backup, Duplicati, was not the best for this purpose. My backup runs would not complete, they would be slow, and full of syncing errors.</description>

<p>I wanted to use this space for backing up my NAS, but it was proving difficult. The program I was recommended for Linux backup, Duplicati, was not the best for this purpose. My backup runs would not complete, they would be slow, and full of syncing errors.</p>
<p>Until I discovered rclone.</p>
<p>rclone was much better than Duplicati at backing up my NAS to Google Drive.</p>
<p>This is the script I use to sync the NAS content to Google Drive: <a href="https://github.com/wordswords/dotfiles/blob/568a8768154de8609a01b26560373ec5ca0eab85/bin/rclone-backup.sh">https://github.com/wordswords/dotfiles/blob/568a8768154de8609a01b26560373ec5ca0eab85/bin/rclone-backup.sh</a></p>
<p>It works just like rsync, but with a progress indicator. I&rsquo;ve added it to my crontab and it syncs everything up weekly.</p>

      <description>I had planned a different network toplogy for sure, but this is my current setup and it seems to work well:
I was not able to implement connection load balancing using the Miktrotik router. It was just too complicated and didn&amp;rsquo;t work reliably enough. My current network is a gigabit network across all areas, so every PC has gigabit cables, switch and so on. I either have plugged in my Virgin Media 1000mb/50mbs internet connection or my BRSK fibre 900mb/900mb connection.</description>

<li>I either have plugged in my Virgin Media 1000mb/50mbs internet connection or my BRSK fibre 900mb/900mb connection. I simply plug in the WAN cable from the main Linksys router into one of the hubs at one time. If one connection goes down, I manually switch over.</li>
<li>I have a 10GB/sec SFP link between my server upstairs in the study and my main studio PC downstairs. This allows me to transfer files at 10Gb/sec rate between the two.</li>
<li>I need two wireless repeaters, even though I have a small house, because the house walls are made of a concrete mix. This means the wireless signal needs boosting a lot.</li>
<li>In the future, I may try load balancing again, or wait until one of my service providers offers &gt;1000mb/sec speeds. When this happens it would make sense to expand the 10Gbs/sec links as there would be more point.</li>

      <description>I have nearly 20 years experience, so my skill-set is in high demand from all sorts of different organisations. If I were looking for a job, then these would be my priorities:
Understanding of medical appointments - My situation is that I currently have cancer. Although it&amp;rsquo;s recommended I work, some of my time will be spent in medical appointments at the hospital that is 15 mins walk away from me.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have nearly 20 years experience, so my skill-set is in high demand from all sorts of different organisations. If I were looking for a job, then these would be my priorities:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Understanding of medical appointments</strong> - My situation is that I currently have cancer. Although it&rsquo;s recommended I work, some of my time will be spent in medical appointments at the hospital that is 15 mins walk away from me. Currently this is expected to take up 1 weekday every fortnight.</li>
<li><strong>100% working from home</strong> - This means that, several years down the line, the company policy will NOT change to &rsquo;everyone in the office&rsquo;. Almost all meetings should be remote-first, meaning that everyone is an equal participant in them if they are working remotely. Some people can of course dial in from an office location but they should be at no communication advantage compared to remote workers. Also, the main communication for the team and organisation should be done online, remote workers should not be &lsquo;second class citizens&rsquo; to water-cooler gossip.</li>
<li><strong>No Java technology stack</strong> - This means that Java and IntelliJ are not used as the mainstay of the application stack. I do not like working with Java and find it convoluted.</li>
<li><strong>No unethical industries</strong> - This means no gambling, no defence, no industries which disadvantage society in a big way in general.</li>
<li><strong>Good Pension</strong> - An above-average pension contribution. I would expect to be seeing at least 6% max employer contribution which is double the NEST minimum.</li>
<li><strong>Good Pay</strong> - This is negotiable but I need to pay my bills, and that includes the 10% inflationary cost of living crisis we&rsquo;re in.</li>
<li><strong>Ability to use my own development environment</strong> - My customised development environment will run without issue on Linux machines, OSX machines, and on Windows 11 with WSL2. I am SO much more productive and happy using it.</li>
<li><strong>Learning and dev time or budget allocated (nice to have)</strong> - This is a &rsquo;nice to have&rsquo; but really if you aren&rsquo;t able and willing to expense costs such as monthly technical books (£50/month) maybe you should be asking yourself why not, as an organisation.</li>

      <title>Sleep Tracking</title>

      <description>I really like my Withings Mattress-Based Sleep Tracker.
I keep unusual sleeping hours a lot of the time, as I&amp;rsquo;m undergoing treatment, and a lot of the medication I&amp;rsquo;m taking effect my sleep. Even when I&amp;rsquo;m relatively healthy, some of the medication I&amp;rsquo;m on for a long-term condition also affects my sleep.
What&amp;rsquo;s more, I enjoy a non-standard sleeping schedule. I find I get more work done in the early morning or late at night.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really like my <a href="https://www.withings.com/it/en/sleep-analyzer">Withings Mattress-Based Sleep Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>I keep unusual sleeping hours a lot of the time, as I&rsquo;m undergoing treatment, and a lot of the medication I&rsquo;m taking effect my sleep. Even when I&rsquo;m relatively healthy, some of the medication I&rsquo;m on for a long-term condition also affects my sleep.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, I enjoy a non-standard sleeping schedule. I find I get more work done in the early morning or late at night. As I work from home 100% this is not as problematic as it used to be.</p>
<p>It is still good to monitor your sleep though, when you are ill or like me, when you have odd sleeping hours.</p>
<p>Like a lot of these smart health things, it is not perfect. Sometimes it will create erroneous data, and then correct itself a few days later, such as when I was in hospital, and it registered someone sleeping in my bed :D My wife was quite surprised when I told her. Thankfully for both of us it corrected itself a day later.</p>
<p>Also it comes up with all this wake-up time and time spend in bed not sleeping, data which I don&rsquo;t really trust. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s reliable enough. The core metric, amount of time asleep, is fairly accurate though, within a few hours. When averaged over 1-2 weeks it does give you a good general idea of how much sleep you&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>Sleep is so important for recovery and feeling well. You can compare the statistics of two fortnights, one when I was being pumped full of steroids and hardly sleeping at all, and one when I was relatively medication free and relaxed:</p>
<h3 id="not-relaxed">Not Relaxed:</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sleep-then.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>As you can see, I was getting max about 3 hours a night.</p>
<h3 id="relaxed">Relaxed:</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/latest-sleep.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Although the latest week is not full, it&rsquo;s a much more healthy 6 hours or so on average.</p>
<p>I find if I am logging 2-3 hours a night sleep for more than a couple of weeks, something is seriously wrong, however I might feel at the time, and I should see a medical professional about it. It is easy to forget this when you might be energised and &ldquo;doing all the things&rdquo; but there is a danger that you might be manic or hyperactive and that really isn&rsquo;t good long term. So this is why I recommend the sleep tracker.</p>

      <title>Digital Game Collecting</title>

      <description>I have a relatively obscure hobby - I collect digital video games. Quite a few people collect physical games, but I like the advantages of having a large library of gaming options which are just a download away.
Like a lot of collectors, I have more games than I have actually played, or probably will do in my lifetime. I mostly get them via discounted bundles such as HumbleBundle.com, so I rarely play full price for them.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a relatively obscure hobby - I collect digital video games. Quite a few
people collect physical games, but I like the advantages of having a large
library of gaming options which are just a download away.</p>
<p>Like a lot of collectors, I have more games than I have actually played, or
probably will do in my lifetime. I mostly get them via discounted bundles such
as <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com">HumbleBundle.com</a>, so I rarely play full price for them.</p>
<p>I use the excellent games launcher <a href="https://playnite.link">Playnite</a> to organize
and consolidate all my games from the various proprietary launchers, such as
Origin and GOG Galaxy. It also downloads a lot of metadata for each game,
including gameplay video trailers, and provides a customizable interface for
everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dipped into emulation for some games that I used to own. But I try and keep
that minimal because of the legal grey area it is under. I have ripped ISOs of
the console games I used to have, before I gave them away to a charity shop.</p>
<p>Some people worry that with digital collections the proprietary launcher company
will go bust, and you will lose access to all your games. To be honest I&rsquo;m not worried
about this as I&rsquo;m fairly sure under that situation they would provide an option
to transfer to a different launcher, or allow downloads of your entire account.
I also use 2-factor authentication on everything, and keep a close eye on
security alerts.</p>
<p>I have been collecting games on Steam since 2004 or so, so I have a large
collection. It is interesting going through the various games and finding out
more about them. I definitely don&rsquo;t play everything, and most games for not very
long, but it is a good distraction from the worries of life.</p>
<p>Here are my statistics from Playnite:</p>

<p>Now that I actually have the internet connectivity being installed to make use of it, I am getting my home network design a bit more finished.</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Virgin Hub providing a 1100/50mbps connection</li>
<li>BetterInternet Fibre Hub providing a 900/900mbps connection</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi 3 running Pi-Hole DNS</li>
<li>MikroTik CRS309-1G-8S+IN Cloud Router Switch</li>

<li>TP-Link Gigabit switch</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Load-balancing internet connections:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I will be using the Linux kernel balance-rr round robin load balancing between the two internet connections on the Miktrotik router which should result on aggregate connection speeds that utilise the connections more extensively, although I doubt they will ever be fully utilised in this configuration for a while.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ThinkStation Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I aim to use this as an always-on server, and also use it as a firewall/bridge/IDS to help further secure the study computers from the rest of the network.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Connection Speeds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The only two computers which will be initially able to reach &gt;1gbit speeds are my studio PC and ThinkStation server as they are the only ones that will be directly connected from the Miktrotik router at faster than 1gbits speeds. All other wired devices will be 1Gb/sec capped, or in the case of wireless, a more realistic 500mbps throughout my home.</li>

      <description>I have had this knowledge in my head for a long time now and thought it would be better to write a diagram to explain the current setup for my MIDI routing.
I use MIDI routing one way - MIDI OUT - from my UMC1820 sound interface.
I have two keyboard controllers, one next to my computer, and one next to my Eurorack, that are attached via USB to my computer which I route the notes via Ableton to the MIDI out of the UMC1820 interface.</description>

<p>I then selectively record the synths that I want to record. I don&rsquo;t use MIDI channels, everything is making a sound at once when I press a key on the keyboard controller. I just record the hardware synths that I want to use in the track.</p>
<p>If I want to use multiple hardware synths in a track then I do multiple MIDI tracks and multiple records.</p>

      <description>Did some network design for my home network. This will ensure that my new Virgin Media 1100mbps/50mps speed is fully utilised without any bottlenecks and will futureproof things up to at least 2.5Gbs/speed connections.
I should be able to load balance both internet connections to utilise them both simultaniously in the future, but for now I want to be able to get greater than 1000mbit/s speed on a single device otherwise there is not much point in speed increases past 1000mbits.</description>

Also there is a 200-300mbits speed increase possible from my existing VM hardware that is not utilised in the current network.</p>
<p>I will be using this method to extract the full speed from the VM hub: <a href="https://tech.msh100.uk/virgin/networking/2020/10/17/virgin-media-greater-than-gbit/">https://tech.msh100.uk/virgin/networking/2020/10/17/virgin-media-greater-than-gbit/</a></p>
<p>Since I have drawn up the diagram, there have been a few improvements suggested - using fibre and fibre modules instead of CAT 7 and more expensive modules to convert to CAT 7.</p>

<h3 id="audio-out-setup">Audio Out Setup</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have the crossfader set to the default setup, so that decks 1 and 3 are on the left crossfader and decks 2 and 4 are assigned to the right crossfader. I have the crossfader curve setup on the default 12 oclock position.</li>
<li>I have master out, booth out and zone out all exact copies of each other, and pulling off the currently selected crossfader mixed output.</li>
<li>I have the master out using three pin XLR connectors going to my audio interface that is hooked up to my speakers and the Twitch broadcasting client.</li>
<li>I have the booth out going to my Eurorack which I have setup with an envelope follower module and an oscilloscope so that I can plot the volume envelope for just a nice visual effect.</li>
<li>I have the zone out going to my VU meter (not shown in picture) so that I can monitor the master out levels easily and also it looks good on stream.</li>
<li>I have feedback suppression turned on just in case my microphones pick up any feedback from the speakers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a MIDI cable running from the Roland 707m to the Behringer TD-3 so that I can sync the acid patterns according to the beat of the inbuilt Roland drum machine on Deck 3.</p>

<p>For using FFMPEG to split a ripped bluray track into episode segments, I look up the series on <a href="https://thetvdb.com">https://thetvdb.com</a> which has fairly accurate epsiode runtimes, and then for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span> ffmpeg.exe -i &#39;.\Samurai Jack Season 1_001.mp4&#39; -acodec copy -vcodec copy -ss 01:11:43 -t 00:23:00 samurai_jack_s01e04.mp4
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>.\Samurai Jack Season 1_001.mp4 is the source file</li>
<li>01:11:43 is the start time</li>
<li>00:23:00 is the duration</li>
<li>samurai_jack_s01e04.mp4 - is the destination file. I use Plex Media Server prefered titling for TV series, e.g. this is Series 1 Episode 4. This makes it easy to import with Plex.</li>
</ul>
<p>I then test the episode in VLC by looking at the start and end of the file to make sure the split is correct, and adjusting the start/end times and re-running as appropriate.</p>

      <title>Using VIM as a Word Processor</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2022/03/08/using-vim-as-a-word-processor/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 19:43:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://davidcraddock.net/2022/03/08/using-vim-as-a-word-processor/</guid>
      <description>It may surprise some people to learn that I don&amp;rsquo;t use a word processor to write pure text any more, and haven&amp;rsquo;t for several months. I still have a subscription to Microsoft Office 365, and probably will as long as recruiters and offices around the world still pay the MS tax.
I have created my own custom writing environment in my favourite text editor, VIM. This may sound like an absolutely foolish thing to do to anyone who knows VIM.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may surprise some people to learn that I don&rsquo;t use a word processor to write pure text any more, and haven&rsquo;t for several months. I still have a subscription to Microsoft Office 365, and probably will as long as recruiters and offices around the world still pay the MS tax.</p>
<p>I have created my own custom writing environment in my favourite text editor, VIM. This may sound like an absolutely foolish thing to do to anyone who knows VIM. By default, it is not setup at all to be an effective word processor. It is a programmers text editor, and a very complex and difficult to learn one at that.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 years or so, I have been slowly customizing it to exactly my needs. The great thing about VIM is that it is highly customizable, and you can change almost every major element of it to suit your tastes.</p>
<p>I use the following plugins when writing text or markdown files.</p>
<h2 id="vim-pencil">Vim Pencil</h2>
<p>This changes the wrapping mode and a number of other VIM options to make VIM suitable as a word processor instead of just a programmers code editor.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/preservim/vim-pencil">https://github.com/preservim/vim-pencil</a></p>
<h2 id="goyo">GOYO</h2>
<p>This is a distraction free way of writing. Because of the way I have set it up, there is a lot going on in the default interface of VIM. This strips everything away to just what you see in this screenshot:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/goyo.png" type="" alt=""  /><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim">https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim</a></p>
<p>I toggle the &lsquo;GOYO&rsquo; mode by pressing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<h2 id="spell">Spell</h2>
<p>VIM&rsquo;s default spellchecker. I use it in British English mode (of course). As soon as I type a misspelled word, it highlights it. Then I can use the arrow keys to skip between each misspelling and fix it with some keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<h2 id="wordy">Wordy</h2>
<p>This picks up words which are not helpful. For example, I have a bad habit of using the word &lsquo;actually&rsquo; too many times. Wordy will highlight this. It has a number of dictionaries of &lsquo;useless&rsquo; words which it will check for. It is opinionated, but I find it does help improve the quality of my writing.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/reedes/vim-wordy">https://github.com/reedes/vim-wordy</a></p>
<h2 id="languagetool-checker">LanguageTool Checker</h2>
<p>This is a Java-based command-line open-source grammar and spell checker. It is very thorough and picks up a lot of things. I don&rsquo;t know how it compares to MS Word&rsquo;s checking, but I find it more useful than I remember Word&rsquo;s grammar checker being.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/languagetoolchecker.png" type="" alt=""  /><a href="https://github.com/dpelle/vim-LanguageTool">https://github.com/dpelle/vim-LanguageTool</a></p>

<p>This is my current DJ setup with the following components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decks 1 and 2 - 2x Reloop 8000mk2 Vinyl Turntables with Serato intergration</li>
<li>Deck 3 - Numark NDX500 CDJ with Serato Integration</li>
<li>Deck 4 - Roland 707m Serato Controller and Mixer using its internal drum machine as a deck</li>
<li>Behringer TB-303 Clone fed into the Aux input of the Roland 707m Controller</li>
<li>Pioneer EFX-1000 DJ FX Unit placed between the master out of the 707m controller and the input of the sound interface on the broadcasting PC</li>
<li>Reloop Neon Serato Controller used to control the Serato DJ Pro sampler</li>
<li>Rode Procaster Microphone (not shown in diagram) fed to the Mic 1 channel on the 707m Controller as the main microphone for me while DJing</li>
<li>t.bone MB 88U Dual Microphone (not shown in diagram) fed to the Mic 2 channel on the 707m Controller as the guest microphone for use when I have guests in the studio</li>
</ol>
<p>I have simplified things massively over the last year over my previous setups with the purchase of the Roland 707m. It it an amazingly clever piece of equipment and does so much. I think it is definitely one of the most advanced and most powerful controllers on the market today. This is what I can do with the new setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can now do 3 deck mixing with the NDX500 CDJ functioning as a third Serato deck, OR using one of the platters on the 707m to use as a third deck. Originally my ambition was to progress to 4 deck mixing which this setup can do, but actually I&rsquo;m sure 3 deck mixing will be enough for the long term future for my needs (plus it&rsquo;s difficult enough!!)</li>
<li>I am keen as ever to go above and beyond simple beatmatching and add creative music artist tricks into my DJing. To this end I have the Roland drum machine built into the 707m. Mostly I will use it for simple redrum effects, but it can also be used to put down a simple beat to put other things over. I also am keen to use the TB-303 with its inbuilt memory of classic acid patterns to possibly play over the Roland drum machine as an intermission between techno/acid tracks, which I do play quite a bit.</li>
<li>DJ FX are fun to use, although I have to be careful not to overuse them! I have full control over the Serato FX on each deck via the 707m which I use quite a bit. I also have the Pioneer EFX-1000 which can do some amazing transition FX. Unfortunately I can only put this on the master channel due to the 707m not fully supporting send/recieve to my liking, but I am sure it will be fine.</li>
<li>The Serato DJ Sampler is very useful while Twitch.tv streaming to add some personal &lsquo;sound bites&rsquo; and entertaining vocal quotes from movies etc, and the Reloop Neon controller is the best Serato sampler controller, and it is cheap and intuitive.</li>
<li>The Roland 707m has some amazingly advanced mic controls, and I can apply full EQing and an effect to each mic. I use the echo effect for a stadium echo type sound when announcing new people entering my stream. It is a bit silly but people like it.</li>
<li>When I get bored of Serato DVS, I can play real vinyl records on my turntables and CDs on my CDJ. This is useful for all-vinyl sets which I occasionally do with my growing record collection. I also have tons of CDs that are fun to use.</li>
<li>With the Reloop 8000mk2s I can actually use the Reloop 800mk2 controller pads and Serato controls in combination with the 707m Serato controller pads. This is very powerful because it means I can use the splice loop effect with one hand at the same time as pressing the buttons to reduce the loop length with the other hand for a &lsquo;fatboy slim stutter drop&rsquo; type effect. There are other combinations that can only really be done with seperate and dedicated controls for each Serato function instead of having to flip between multi-use Serato pads.</li>
</ol>

      <title>Working with Jenkinsfiles in VIM</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2022/02/19/working-with-jenkinsfiles-in-vim/</link>

      <description>Using Jenkinsfiles in repositories for declarative pipelines, which is an example as infrastructure as code, is absolutely the right thing to do, in my opinion.
However the tooling for debugging and error checking Jenkinsfiles is currently quite difficult.
Setup Jenkinsfile linter First of all you need to make sure to be able to access the Jenkinsfile linter. This linter is processed on the Jenkins server itself, unusually. There is a configuration option that requires adminstrator access to the Jenkins server.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using Jenkinsfiles in repositories for declarative pipelines, which is an example as infrastructure as code, is absolutely the right thing to do, in my opinion.</p>
<p>However the tooling for debugging and error checking Jenkinsfiles is currently quite difficult.</p>
<h2 id="setup-jenkinsfile-linter">Setup Jenkinsfile linter</h2>
<p>First of all you need to make sure to be able to access the Jenkinsfile linter. This linter is processed on the Jenkins server itself, unusually. There is a configuration option that requires adminstrator access to the Jenkins server.</p>
<p>There are a number of options to access the linter, but Jenkins officially recommends the ssh server option with preshared ssh public keys as outlined here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/development/">https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/development/</a></p>
<p>Once you have set it up, you can pipe Jenkinsfiles through ssh to the linter and it will lint the Jenkinsfile for you:</p>
<p><code>ssh jenkins.dev.mycompany.co.uk -p1337 declarative-linter &lt; Jenkinsfile</code></p>
<p>(change jenkins.dev.mycompany.co.uk and the port number to match your configuration of course)</p>
<p>And it will output the errors in the file.</p>
<h2 id="jenkinsfile-syntax-highlighting-in-vim">Jenkinsfile syntax highlighting in VIM</h2>
<p>VIM won&rsquo;t automatically syntax highlight Jenkinsfiles because they don&rsquo;t have an extension that it recognises. This is easily fixed with the following autocommand added to your .vimrc though:</p>
<p><code>autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile Jenkinsfile set filetype=groovy</code></p>
<p>This will ensure that Jenkinsfiles have some measure of syntax highlighting when loaded, as they are valid Groovy files.</p>
<h2 id="jenkinsfile-linting-on-save-in-vim">Jenkinsfile linting on save in VIM</h2>
<p>Once you have the linter running on a ssh port (see above) you can add this line to your .vimrc to have the linter run whenever a Jenkinsfile is saved, allowing you to debug your changes when you save them:</p>
<p><code>autocmd BufWritePost Jenkinsfile !ssh jenkins.dev.myompany.co.uk -p1337 declarative-linter &lt; %</code></p>
<p>(change jenkins.dev.mycompany.co.uk and the port number to match your configuration of course)</p>
<p>This setup should make it significantly easier to spot and fix errors in your Jenkinsfile before it gets to the git commit stage.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought I&rsquo;d write here a bit about how I got into technology and how my career has progressed for those people wanting to get into technology.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to be born in a supportive home to good parents. My father was an early entrant into the world of computing, and my birth certificate records his profession as a &lsquo;Computer Science Lecturer&rsquo;, which was very rare at the time. In actuality, I&rsquo;m fairly sure he taught only at local higher education colleges, but technically that still made him a lecturer. At any rate, he definitely worked in computing at a time when few others did (1982).</p>
<p>I was always interested in computers as a child. From an early age I was often seen next to the family computers, which were supplied at a regular basis from my dad&rsquo;s workplace as he took home computers to get more familiar with them. I mostly used them for games. I spent a lot of time reading as a lot of people did before the internet. When I was 11 I borrowed a programming book from the library for the BBC Microcomputer and painfully typed in lines and lines of BASIC code from this book for a simple game. It didn&rsquo;t work. Frustrated, I left my programming ambitions there.</p>
<p>When I was 11 (1993) I got my first IBM compatible PC for my &lsquo;schoolwork&rsquo;. This sat in my room at a desk. This was a huge thing for me and I spent most of my spare time next to that thing, mostly playing games.</p>
<p>When I was 13 or 14 I first got online. My mum had an AOL account that she was meant to use for her teaching, and I was able to use it a few hours per week. That was a huge thing for me. I became really interested in hacking and computer security. I spent about an equal time playing online games, chatting online and trying to be a hacker. It opened up a huge new world for me because we lived in a rather sleepy countryside town and had very little access to the bigger world.</p>
<p>My parents in vain tried to restrict me from going online. I took extraordinary measures to get online because there was so much more for me there than old library books and right-wing country viewpoints. Some of these involved staying up until late and taking the modem out of my dad&rsquo;s PC at night and putting it in my computer and surfing the internet all night. Later I got my own phone line extension to my room, briefly. I was allowed a set number of hours per week online and no more. My parents were worried I would spend too much time on the internet and not enough on my studies or the &lsquo;great outside&rsquo;. They were right.</p>
<p>I found ways to repeatedly break their restrictions including programming my Linux PC to repeatedly redial a number infinitely to trigger the relay in the phone socket lock they had put on the master phone socket downstairs. Eventually it ran out of power, and I was able to use the internet when I liked. My dad eventually had enough and disconnected my phone line extension to my room. But by that point the school had internet, and I was able to use it at lunchtimes and in my free time.</p>
<p>I was 16 (1998) and I started Computing A-level classes which involved a lot of practical programming. With my head start in computing I found learning to program easy and fun. I hadn&rsquo;t really excelled in much else at the grammar school I was in so that was a big deal for me. We used Visual Basic 5 and I spent a huge amount of time programming, getting into trouble for hacking the school IT network, and learning about programming.</p>
<p>I ended up repeating the second year of sixth form because of health reasons, so I actually had three years of Computing A-Level. I spent the third year mostly working on a programming project that my dad had arranged with his IT support technician team he managed at the local college he worked in. The project was building a hardware stock management database in MS Access and Visual Basic. It was quite a huge project and I spent a lot of time on it, and also got hired for a month as a summer job continuing to work on it after I had finished it.</p>
<p>I got fairly good A-Level grades for the time and got a place at Sussex University studying Artificial Intelligence with North American Studies. I only took the NA minor because it promised a year in America. Soon however I found I wasn&rsquo;t very good at North American studies, and the tutors took a dim view on my use of Chomsky in my papers around 9/11 and the far left American viewpoints I was into. So I changed my degree to Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence after the first year.</p>
<p>University was a time of great social adjustment and life experiences for me, and I had some quite serious mental health problems at university. This caused me to take a year out. I spent that year mostly geeking out and expanding my computing knowledge. A succession of summer jobs followed including some web development, QA testing for computer games, and finally working for a web start-up as a PHP developer.</p>
<p>I struggled at university mainly because I didn&rsquo;t have the maths background for my degree. The courses assumed knowledge of A-Level maths, but I had never taken A-Level maths, and it was never asked for. So I found it very difficult studying advanced neural network algorithms, for example. Most of the degree though I found very interesting, and I got a lot out from it. My dissertation was another software project arranged with a local company, and I got a 2:1 for it, although the company was not interested in hiring me after I graduated.</p>
<p>It was 2005 when I graduated, and got a job at £13,500 per year as a junior developer working on MS Access/Visual Basic database front ends for a telemarketing company. The development team were impressed with my degree as none of them had degrees. I really didn&rsquo;t like working there though, and only stuck it out for 6 months before moving on.</p>
<p>I worked a number of short term IT and software jobs, only sticking in one role for over a year. Various titles included PHP Developer, IT manager, SEO Analyst and Configuration and Support Administrator. I didn&rsquo;t like the people I worked with, and I didn&rsquo;t like the environments. The training and support was more or less non-existent which was a problem for me, as I didn&rsquo;t really know what I was doing.</p>
<p>I was also DJing a lot in my spare time, and partying. Brighton is famous for its hedonism and I totally got caught up in that, and had a great time (mostly). At one point I was DJing in clubs two nights mid-week, not getting home till 2am or 3am on those nights, and having to start work the next day at 9am! Needless to say, even with the energy of being young, it took a toll on my work life.</p>
<p>This and the suboptimal career I had, culminated in me burning out quite heavily in 2008/2009. This coincided with the Great Recession in the UK, so jobs were difficult to find. I ended up moving from Brighton to my parents and spent around a year getting better and fitter, cycling every day for hours, and taking on some part-time tech work, but nothing full-time.</p>
<p>In 2010 my parents had had enough of me lounging around the house, so it was time for my next steps. I applied to an MSc course at Kent University, I applied to a tech job in Kent and I applied to the BBC in London. I got accepted by all three, which was nice. In the end, I chose to go with the BBC and moved to London, staying in an incredibly small and expensive flatshare in East Acton and cycling to White City every day.</p>
<p>After a year the BBC moved our department to Manchester, and I was asked if I wanted to go, which I definitely did. I had visited Manchester before in 2009 for a cycling trip while I was unemployed, staying in hostels to minimize cost, and was amazed with the amount of space there was compared to the South East. And the prices too for a big city.</p>
<p>So I ended up moving (2011) to the BBC offices in Media:City UK in Salford Manchester with my girlfriend at the time. Manchester was so cheap back then that we were able to rent a large flat in NumberOne, which was actually attached to the building I was working in! This was very convenient for me, and it was a luxury arrangement compared to life in London.</p>
<p>I spent 7 years at the BBC and learned and a lot about technology and Agile software development. There was a huge investment in learning in our teams, and there was the BBC Academy which ran some good courses on software development. We also got sent to conferences and had coaches come in to give us lessons during our work day. It was a good place to learn.</p>
<p>After a while I realized that it was not a good place for senior engineers and I had watched the budgets steadily been cut back and back over the years. My wage hadn&rsquo;t really moved for years and I thought it was time for a change.</p>
<p>I moved to Arm (2017) which really was a huge change in a number of ways! It was focused on C++ and embedded software development whereas the BBC was much more about web development. Arm also hadn&rsquo;t adopted Agile at all, and was not really a collaborative place: it was a place for geniuses who liked to work on their own.</p>
<p>While I definitely liked to work on my own, and I learned a lot while at Arm through their excruciatingly accurate code reviews, the environment was definitely not right for me. I left after two years there.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today (2022) where I have worked for a couple more organizations and seem to have found a niche as a &lsquo;software automation engineer&rsquo;: which is a combination of DevOps, QA tester, and developer. I have several years experience covering each, so it is a good role for me, and is in demand.</p>

      <description>Ever since I worked at an internet marketing company on an advertising analytics platform, I have realised that I don&amp;rsquo;t want my personal internet browsing tracked, monetised, influenced, and sold to the highest bidder. These are the steps that I have taken to reduce (you can never totally eliminate) this process.

These are the steps that I have taken to reduce (you can never totally eliminate) this process.</p>
<h2 id="pi-hole-dns">Pi-Hole DNS</h2>
<p>This is a DNS server installed on a Raspberry Pi on my local home network. I have all the internet traffic going through my Virgin Media router filtered through this DNS server. It has many privacy-boosting features, but its main claim to fame is that it blocks the vast majority of internet advertising and analytics traffic on the DNS level. It currently blocks 20% of the requests made, which results in approximately 20% faster internet for me, and a lot more privacy/less tracking/less adverts.</p>
<p><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">https://pi-hole.net/</a></p>
<h2 id="firefox-browser">Firefox Browser</h2>
<p>Using the Firefox Browser is kind of a no-brainer for internet privacy, because of out of all the main browsers available it is open-source and not controlled by a large commercial tech company. It has the best default privacy features out of all the browsers I&rsquo;ve used. I use it on all my devices and the configuration is synced across all of them.</p>
<h2 id="adblocker-ultimate-firefox-extension">AdBlocker Ultimate Firefox Extension</h2>
<p>This is the best web page advert remover I have used. It is constantly updated with new ways of removing adverts as the main companies like Facebook find ways around it. It currently removes all the adverts on all the web pages I browse on, including Facebook, which is quite a feat.</p>
<h2 id="clearurls-firefox-extension">ClearURLs Firefox Extension</h2>
<p>This removes all tracking elements from URLs in web pages you load, automatically. Tracking elements are information passed through in parameters appended to the end of web page links which provide information on where the traffic has come from and the tracked behaviour of the web user on the previous site. This is particularly important in advertising analytics, and breaking this chain between websites does a lot to protect your privacy.</p>
<h2 id="fakespot-fake-amazon-reviews-and-ebay-sellers-firefox-extension">Fakespot Fake Amazon Reviews and eBay Sellers Firefox Extension</h2>
<p>This plugin is not strictly related to privacy but does help an awful lot on online shopping. It analyses Amazon and eBay reviewers for patterns to help understand whether they are fabricated or not. Often online merchants will use fake reviews to boost an otherwise mediocre product. This helps me save money on those.</p>
<h2 id="kaspersky-anti-virus-protection">Kaspersky Anti-Virus Protection</h2>
<p>This is another level of general internet protection from the paid Kaspersky anti-virus product. Kaspersky costs me a small subscription every year but it is better than the free alternatives, and offers this browser plugin which has been helpful in sniffing out malware.</p>

      <title>The Persuit of Happiness and the Hill-Climbing Problem</title>

      <description>It seems that for a lot of people, perhaps the vast majority, they cannot expect to be 100% happy all the time. Even those incredibly successful celebrities and incredibly rich CEOs and politicians are not happy 100% of the time.
So is it a good idea to seek 100% happiness right away? Or should we always try and select the &amp;rsquo;least worst&amp;rsquo; situation? If we keep making progress and optimse our happiness levels through constantly selecting the &amp;rsquo;least worst&amp;rsquo; situation whenever we have a descision then it seems to me we will maximise our happiness potential in the long run.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems that for a lot of people, perhaps the vast majority, they cannot expect to be 100% happy all the time. Even those incredibly successful celebrities and incredibly rich CEOs and politicians are not happy 100% of the time.</p>
<p>So is it a good idea to seek 100% happiness right away? Or should we always try and select the &rsquo;least worst&rsquo; situation? If we keep making progress and optimse our happiness levels through constantly selecting the &rsquo;least worst&rsquo; situation whenever we have a descision then it seems to me we will maximise our happiness potential in the long run.</p>
<p>Once we have reached the plateau of happiness for our chosen path though, and we are not getting any happier or there is no way to continue improving our happiness, then the only way of potentially improving our happiness is to do something radical and leap to another approach.</p>
<p>For those with training in A.I. or optimisation algorithms, I see this conceptually as see this as a hill-climbing local optimsation plateau problem. You can optimise locally your happiness level, but you need to take a risk when you have plateau&rsquo;d in your happiness along your current path, to do something completely different and jump to another hill which might offer a higher level of happiness in the long run, although it may not. The amount of risk you take is dependant on the knowledge you have (the heuristics) that the next &lsquo;hill&rsquo; or path you take will lead to a better outcome. But.. if it won&rsquo;t, and all the paths available to you have been analysed, and you will not make yourself happier, you have won at the happiness problem. You are the happiest you can make yourself and no amount of seeking happiness improvements in your life will help.</p>
<p>This can be extended to job hopping, relationships.. of course there is an amount of risk as we never have a perfect heuristic but the concept is the same. Through constantly hopping hills and constantly seeking 100% happiness you can make yourself less happy than you thought. Maybe you were never born to be 100% happy? Maybe none of us ever were, we can just do the best with the oppertunities we were given.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I explained it well but this does a better job:</p>

      <title>Retrospective on 2021</title>

      <description>Well, 2021 has been a bit of a downer in a number of ways. There has been some upsides though.
I spent the first part of 2021 burned out, as in - totally burned out - of my career and really needing a break. This affected my work. It turns out that unknown to me at the time, I had cancer, Hodgkins Lymophoma, and a lot of my lack of energy and generally feeling awful was down to a large tumor that had been growing my chest for some time and was pressing down on my heart and lungs.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, 2021 has been a bit of a downer in a number of ways. There has been some upsides though.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/eurorack.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<ul>
<li>I spent the first part of 2021 burned out, as in - totally burned out - of my career and really needing a break. This affected my work. It turns out that unknown to me at the time, I had cancer, Hodgkins Lymophoma, and a lot of my lack of energy and generally feeling awful was down to a large tumor that had been growing my chest for some time and was pressing down on my heart and lungs. In June I was admitted to hospital and they diagnosed the cancer. In July I started chemotherapy. Now the good news is that Hodgkins Lymphoma is one of the best cancers to get if you were able to choose, as it has a very high cure rate and very low fatality rate. The chemo as of November&rsquo;s scan seems to be working even better than expected and they were expecting a good outcome. So that is positive. I should hopefully be done with chemo by March 2022.</li>
<li>One of the good things about 2021 has been the job that I found in the music industry. It is still doing software engineering, what my career has been based around, but they seem like a very nice bunch of people, and were prepared to support me and keep me on around chemotherapy. I am still employed part-time and that has been a HUGE help financially as you really don&rsquo;t get a lot of money in benefits from the government, even when you have cancer it seems, and my family have had to help me out quite a bit. I have also had some success in the work that I&rsquo;ve been doing - it seems very appreciated which is something I&rsquo;m not really used to!</li>
<li>I have continued DJing on Twitch which has been great. I still do my regular Sunday show for 4 hours most Sundays, and it is a lot of fun and I have a bunch of regulars who pop in. I enjoy it a lot. I reached 500 followers and raised a LOT of money via charity streams with other DJs, both as a DJ and also helping as an organiser.</li>
<li>In December Conny and I caught the omicron varient of COVID-19 and that was a huge worry at the time because of my low immune system due to chemo and cancer. However we both have beaten it now, I had a short stay in hospital but it wasn&rsquo;t that bad. NHS staff were very helpful and I think it really helped that I had 3 vaccinations in my system at the time of catching it.</li>
<li>In Jan 2021 I took the third of the 10 week university level courses at Point Blank Music School as part of my study of Electronic Music Production. This course was on mixing and mastering. I have learned a lot from it already, although I still haven&rsquo;t finished it as I was quite busy most of the year.</li>
<li>I single-handedly raised £270 from friends and family for a cancer charity for my mother (who also has cancer) during a 12 hour DJ stream on my birthday in 2021. Ironically I had no idea I had cancer myself at the time.</li>
<li>I ripped all of CDs to FLAC. Hundreds of CDs. Ripped hundreds of DVDs, PS2 and PS1 games too. Hosted them all on a Plex media server and gave the majority of discs away to charity.</li>
<li>I sorted all my physical books, split into different subject bookshelves, alphabeticalised and catalogued in GoodReads.com.</li>
<li>I have read more books this year than several previous years. I still have a huge backlog to go through though.</li>
<li>I played quite a few more computer games than I have for a while, including beating Cyberpunk 2077 in a no-sleep 28 hour marathon after it was released. (Although that was technically in December 2020 I am going to include it anyway). It was such a great game in my view, amazing storyline and setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to 2022!</p>

      <description>Enlightenment is a very underrated window manager choice, in my opinion. It still looks very pretty and is very configurable. There is a packaging bug with the latest version of Enlightement in the 21.10 repo which means it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work correctly. The fix is to set the suid bit on the &amp;rsquo;enlightenment_system&amp;rsquo; binary. So:
sudo apt install enlightenment sudo find /usr/lib -type f -name enlightenment_system -exec sudo chmod 4755 {} \; Log out of Ubuntu Click the settings cog in the bottom right to change your Window manager to enlightenment Log on and the settings wizard will help you configure Enlightenment </description>

      <description>This is a simple description of how I work 99% of the time, as I am a simpleton. Origin/main is the new origin/master for future repositories, I just note both here for completeness because I use origin master for a lot of current repos.
I first make sure I am uptodate on origin/master or origin/main by git pulling. git checkout origin master git pull origin master I start making changes to the local copy on my local machine.</description>

<ol>
<li>I first make sure I am uptodate on origin/master or origin/main by git pulling.</li>
<li><code>git checkout origin master</code></li>
<li><code>git pull origin master</code></li>
<li>I start making changes to the local copy on my local machine.</li>
<li>When it gets to a point where I want to save my changes, I:</li>
<li><code>git stash push</code></li>
<li><code>git checkout -b &lt;branch name which will be made into a PR&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>git stash pop</code></li>
<li>I then commit the changes to the new branch.</li>
<li><code>git commit</code></li>
<li>When I am ready to create the PR, I create and push to the remote branch:</li>
<li><code>git push origin &lt;branch name which will be made into a PR&gt;</code></li>
<li>Github will tell me if master/main has diverged past a state where my commits can be merged in without conflict. If there is a possible conflict, I will merge in origin master/main to my local copy and then push to the PR branch again:</li>
<li><code>git checkout &lt;branch name which will be made into a PR&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>git pull origin master (or origin main)</code></li>
<li>I resolve locally conflicts through <code>git mergetool</code> which, for me, is vim&rsquo;s three way diff tool.</li>
<li>I commit the updated conflicts and push to the remote branch - <code>git add &amp;&amp; git commit &amp;&amp; git push origin &lt;branch name which will be made into a PR&gt;</code></li>
<li>Often at this point I find I have to add new commits to fix things I have broken or have been flagged up in PR review.</li>
<li><code>git commit</code></li>
<li><code>git push origin &lt;branch name which will be made into a PR&gt;</code></li>
<li>Reviewers now have some of their comments made on stale commits in Github. This is better than squashing the commits I find because sometimes the commits are not stale and their comments are still valid, and it becomes easier to keep track of. They can view the &lsquo;files changed&rsquo; tab to add review comments until they are happy. I loop back to check whether master/main has diverged, and if it hasn&rsquo;t just keep adding commits to address their concerns.</li>
<li>The PR gets approved (hopefully)</li>
<li>I merge the PR into master or main</li>
<li>I delete the old branch</li>
</ol>

      <title>How to fix Plex Media Servers &#39;Various Artists&#39; problem using Beets.io and other tools</title>

      <description>The Problem As of the day of posting, Plex Media Server has a suboptimal handling of Various Artists compilations. Unless you follow BOTH of these rules, described clearly on the Plex support here under &amp;lsquo;Various Artists&amp;rsquo;, then they won&amp;rsquo;t appear collected under a particular album, they will be spread out filed under the different artists that created them. I think it should only require one of these rules, but it is not up to me.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>As of the day of posting, Plex Media Server has a suboptimal handling of Various Artists compilations. Unless you follow BOTH of these rules, <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/200265296-adding-music-media-from-folders/">described clearly on the Plex support here under &lsquo;Various Artists&rsquo;,</a> then they won&rsquo;t appear collected under a particular album, they will be spread out filed under the different artists that created them. I think it should only require one of these rules, but it is not up to me. The problem is that release metadata available from the online metadata databases, often doesn&rsquo;t follow these rules - lots of DJ mix compilations for example, do not set albumartist tag to Various Artists from the online metadata databases.</p>
<p>Also you may want to adopt a different file structure for your music than what is recommended and essential for Plex. I would agree that ONE of these measures should be required, and I would argue that setting album artist would be enough for Plex to figure out this problem, but you also need to structure your music also under the way they suggest, you won&rsquo;t get the desired result of compilations being collected as a single album and in order.</p>
<h2 id="my-solution">My Solution</h2>
<p>Firstly, you&rsquo;re going to have to manually add the &lsquo;Various Artists&rsquo; content to the &lsquo;albumartist&rsquo; tag for all tracks in a compilation that doesn&rsquo;t have them. Currently I&rsquo;ve only found a way to do this by hand, would be very interested in any automated approaches, or if someone wants to write a beets.io plugin that would be amazing. You can do this with any tag editor, but I wrote my own solution which is faster for what I want to do and easy to use on my existing Beets.io setup and database which has a lot of these problem compilations already. Because I am using Windows I wrote a batch file which uses several third party tools to fix the metadata fast. You will have to download and setup the tools seperately, <a href="https://github.com/wordswords/music-organisation-windows-scripts/blob/main/tag-various-artists.bat">details are in the batch file comments</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, you&rsquo;re going to have to make sure that Beets.io moves your files into the way that Plex Media Server recommends. <a href="https://github.com/wordswords/music-organisation-windows-scripts/blob/main/config.yaml">This is my current Beets.io config file</a>, the important bits here are the file rename and move structure, <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/200265296-adding-music-media-from-folders/">as per the support page</a>, it has to be something along the lines of:</p>
<p><code>$albumartist/$album/$artist - $title</code></p>
<h2 id="my-process">My Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>&lsquo;beet ls <!-- raw HTML omitted --> to identify tracks that need fixing. &lsquo;beet ls fabric&rsquo; for example, got almost all of my dozens of Fabric mix CD tracks, which sped up the renaming significantly than using a GUI editor to go in and manually change each album. You have to make sure that the query string selects only the tracks you want to modify, unless you want to go back and edit those few tracks that got caught in the process later.</li>
<li>I send that query string to my batch file which goes through the &lsquo;beets ls -p &rsquo; full path results iteratively and runs a couple of command line tag editors on them, the first works for all MP3s and the second for all FLACs, e.g. &lsquo;.\tag-various-artists.bat fabric&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;beet update&rsquo; to update my Beets.io database with the new metadata I&rsquo;ve changed with the batch script.</li>
<li>&lsquo;beet dup -d&rsquo; to delete any duplicates that have arisen.</li>
<li>&lsquo;beet move -p&rsquo; to preview the file moves into the new directory structure that is required by Plex.</li>
<li>When I&rsquo;ve scanned through and am happy with the file moves - &lsquo;beet move&rsquo; to do the moving.</li>
<li>I then backup my files through robocopying to an external drive, but this is not essential.</li>
<li>Make sure you have checked &lsquo;prefer existing metadata&rsquo; in the Plex options for your music library.</li>
<li>Set Plex to rescan your libraries metadata.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wordswords/music-organisation-windows-scripts/">The batch file I use, my beets.io config and other tools I use to organise my music collection on Windows 10.</a></p>
<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>
<p>All my Fabric mix CDs are now properly collected under one ordered album each on Plex: <img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fabric.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>

      <description>I have recently been in hospital and been diagnosed with a condition that might mean I need to return quite a bit, at least in the short term. When I was in hospital I was struck by the fact that there were very long periods of waiting and it was easy to get very bored and quite dejected just sitting in a hospital bed.
Also there is not a lot of room for laptops, tablets and other things – you really don’t get a lot of space by your bed usually to store large items and they are not practical most of the time.</description>

<p>I have recently been in hospital and been diagnosed with a condition that might mean I need to return quite a bit, at least in the short term. When I was in hospital I was struck by the fact that there were very long periods of waiting and it was easy to get very bored and quite dejected just sitting in a hospital bed.</p>
<p>Also there is not a lot of room for laptops, tablets and other things – you really don’t get a lot of space by your bed usually to store large items and they are not practical most of the time. Therefore I thought I would hack together some kind of portable entertainment system that I could use to pass the time and to block out some of the hospital negativity if I need to be in hospital again. My DJ headphones Seinhausser HD 2-IIs are actually very useful in a hospital because they are very good at sound isolation and you can remove one of the ear cups so you can lie on your side in a hospital bed and just listen to one earcup without it being uncomfortable, so they were very good to use with the PSP.</p>
<p>I chose the PSP 2000 model as it is very capable of playing emulated games up to Playstation 1 era, which includes my favourites the GBA, SNES and Genesis games. It also has option to watch Sony UMD movies, and the screen is actually very good and clear in the dark and most light settings.</p>
<p>I went through Etsy until I found a seller that was selling custom PSPs. They came with a tested battery, a mint condition screen and you could choose from a number of different cases. I chose the rare special edition Japanese signature Model 000001 Tsukimi case and it came to quite a reasonable price overall, £160 for everything although no memory card was supplied.</p>
<p>When it arrived, I was a bit worried that the screen would be scratched, but when I peeled off the screen protector there was zero damage to the screen. In all other ways it seemed mint, so was very happy. The battery was an official Sony one which still held a charge well, which I was very happy about because it is difficult to find a good battery.</p>
<p>I peeled off the screen protector and put on a new one straight away. I also ordered a 32GB PSP memory card, and a joint USB charge/data transfer cable. When the card arrived I put on the PSP 2000 ‘PRO’ Custom Firmware, allowing me to ‘root’ the device and install third-party software such as emulators on it. I then installed a PSP Snes9x version and downloaded a full complete set of SNES games and copied them to the memory card. I had to split the games up into folders of 200 games or so each otherwise the PSP struggled indexing all the games, but when I had done that they all worked. I could play any Super Nintendo game ever released on the emulator on my PSP and take them anywhere.</p>
<p>I also bought a hardshell carry case for my PSP which will have enough room for a charger, a few Sony UMD disks and the PSP. The PSP 2000 models are different from the 1000 models in that they actually have a HDMI cable available, so you can connect them to a HDMI monitor. So I bought one of those to play when I am home at my desk with my HDMI monitor – it is a much better user experience! See the picture below, it even works well in my 21:9 ultrawide monitor after fiddling with various upscaling options:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mgs.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>I already had a couple of Sony UMD discs and they are very cheap on Ebay, so I splashed out and ordered a complete set of the Harry Potter 1-8 movies. I could definitely just rip movies and put them on the memory card and it would save a lot of hassle but I like the UMD format and as I said they are very cheap nowadays. I may put some additional video file rips on the memory card.</p>
<p>I got ALL the information I could have wanted for this project from the excellent <a href="https://reddit.com/r/psp">Reddit subreddit &lsquo;PSP&rsquo;</a>. Reddit is a font of useful, up to date, technical info and just following the wiki and top links on that subreddit really was all that was required to do everything I needed.</p>

      <title>Making Twitch DJ Promo Mix Videos</title>

      <description>Sometimes as a DJ you may want to reconstruct the Twitch stream you have streamed into a video format to send to other people, for promotional purposes, or just to have a record of what you&amp;rsquo;ve done. Twitch makes this difficult though, as it mutes copyrighted music in the video it records for your Twitch stream. Also, when you download this video, it does not include the chat log, so any attempts at reconstruction are without the chat, so it looks like the DJ is just talking to him/herself.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes as a DJ you may want to reconstruct the Twitch stream you have streamed into a video format to send to other people, for promotional purposes, or just to have a record of what you&rsquo;ve done. Twitch makes this difficult though, as it mutes copyrighted music in the video it records for your Twitch stream. Also, when you download this video, it does not include the chat log, so any attempts at reconstruction are without the chat, so it looks like the DJ is just talking to him/herself. Not good. However you can get past this. This is how I reconstruct a video set to create a promo DJ video mix for my stream. You will need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Twitch.tv VOD recording of your stream</li>
<li>A full audio capture unmuted. I use mixcloud.com for this as I find it very convinent. It is a paid service but it&rsquo;s cheap, and you can just set it as a stream endpoint on Streamlabs OBS and forget about it - it will record all the audio from your streams. Currently there is not an option to download the audio, but you can get past that, see below.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader">https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader</a> - The Twitch Downloader tool that allows you to download chat logs from the Twitch VOD and reconstruct them into a twitch chat pane video</li>
<li>A video editor and some basic video editing skills. iMovie for OSX is good, I use the free Video Editor for Windows 10</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="downloading-the-video-from-twitch">Downloading the video from Twitch</h3>
<p>Just browse to your video section of the creator dashboard and you will have an oppertunity to download the video of your Twitch stream.</p>
<h3 id="downloading-the-audio-from-mixcloud">Downloading the audio from Mixcloud</h3>
<p>Make sure your audio recording is published on your Mixcloud and just use the site <a href="https://www.dlmixcloud.com">https://www.dlmixcloud.com</a> to download a m4a copy of your audio stream.</p>
<h3 id="downloading-and-rendering-the-chat-playback-using-twitch-downloader">Downloading and rendering the chat playback using Twitch Downloader</h3>
<p>This is a great program but is a bit technical. There are two steps you need to do - 1) download the chat logs from a VOD and then 2) Render them into a video. So for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-gdscript3" data-lang="gdscript3"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>\TwitchDownloaderCLI<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>exe <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>m ChatDownload <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>u <span style="color:#ae81ff">1055017670</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>o bla<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>json
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>- where 1055017670 is your VOD ID (find this by browsing to your video on Twitch. the VOD ID will be displayed in the URL)</p>
</li>
<li>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-gdscript3" data-lang="gdscript3"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>\TwitchDownloaderCLI <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>m ChatRender <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>i bla<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>json <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>h <span style="color:#ae81ff">540</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>w <span style="color:#ae81ff">212</span> <span style="color:#f92672">--</span>framerate <span style="color:#ae81ff">30</span> <span style="color:#f92672">--</span>update<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>rate <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span> <span style="color:#f92672">--</span>font<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>size <span style="color:#ae81ff">11</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>o chat<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>mp4
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>- this will render your chat playback in a video file with the dimensions 540x212px and the font-size of 11. This is what I use, you can edit this to suit your tastes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have these three elements, you can use any good video editor to sync the audio with the video, and overlay the chat video onto the video of your stream. Add some titles and there you have a promo video.</p>
<h3 id="distributing-your-promo-dj-mix-video">Distributing your promo DJ mix video</h3>
<p>You may run into problems distributing your video as services like YouTube will flag up that you are using copyrighted music. However you can use the fantastic Handbrake tool to compress your video file into a small filesize, and then upload the resulting video to Google Drive. Then you can set Google Drive to &lsquo;share via link&rsquo; and distribute that link to people you want to watch your video. They will sometimes be offered a live stream option but for best results they need to download the whole video file (so make it small!) and watch in a video player like Windows Media Player.</p>
<h3 id="a-basic-example---heres-one-i-made-earlier">A Basic Example - Here&rsquo;s one I made earlier</h3>
<p>Remember to download the whole file for best results: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qezKXSAvBK29hUCcuRNx1i3-fnodVss9/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qezKXSAvBK29hUCcuRNx1i3-fnodVss9/view</a>
You should (maybe) also be able to preview it here:</p>

      <description>As a DJ it is important to listen to the music in your collection so you get an idea of what would work in particular sets, and you have a memory of how the tracks progress. So I decided to host a Spotify like service in my house so I could listen to my 500GB+ DJ music library. Navidrome (free open source software from https://navidrome.org) is running on the Raspberry Pi 3 which is under my desk via a wired connection with it&amp;rsquo;s own http://navidrome.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a DJ it is important to listen to the music in your collection so you get an idea of what would work in particular sets, and you have a memory of how the tracks progress. So I decided to host a Spotify like service in my house so I could listen to my 500GB+ DJ music library. Navidrome (free open source software from <a href="https://navidrome.org">https://navidrome.org</a>) is running on the Raspberry Pi 3 which is under my desk via a wired connection with it&rsquo;s own <a href="http://navidrome.local">http://navidrome.local</a> custom domain name. This is what it looks like:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/navidrome.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>It remotely mounts the music share on my main Windows PC which is almost always on, and quickly indexes and serves up the content in a Spotify type way.</p>
<p>I have setup an iptables port redirect so that any web traffic to port 80 or port 443 will be redirected to the correct navidrome app port so I don&rsquo;t have to remember the obscure port number just the domain name above. I have also setup AutoFS to automatically detect when my main PC is running and mount the windows share automatically, so everything just works whenever my main PC is switched on and off, and docker-compose automatically loads the container whenever it goes down and the setup persists between reboots of the RPI and the windows PC. I have also installed Plex on the same RPI, using AutoFS so that it mounts and unmounts the video share on my other PC when it is switched on. I have ripped a bunch of comedy videos from my DVDs and BluRays using Handbrake.</p>
<p>Navidrome implements the Subsonic API, so it is compatible with a lot of different applications, including the excellent <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=github.daneren2005.dsub&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US">DSub</a> application for Android which offers a more mobile-friendly streamlined player that connects to my Navidrome server and allows caching and pre-downloading, and a bunch of other cool features.</p>
<p>It provides an easy way for me to browse and play any music from my music collection from anywhere on my network, and it has full metadata added as part of my DJ music metadata workflow (see: /2021/05/05/organising-huge-music-libraries-with-serato/ for more info). I have also setup my RPI3 as a ZeroTier bridge to my local network, meaning I can create a P2P VPN from my phone to stream music via DSub when I am outside the house too, or to access Plex on the RPI from my phone while I&rsquo;m on the move.</p>
<p>Another useful feature is that I can save playlists using Navidrome and download all the files that make up the playlist via the web interface. This is useful for preparing a set and moving all teh files onto my DJing laptop so that I can analyse them in Serato and play them in a Serato crate.</p>

<p>[youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYScinvkrrM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYScinvkrrM</a>]</p>
<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve setup your turntable:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>
<p>Should go without saying that I always use a velvet dust brush on my records just before I play them. Only takes a couple of seconds when you&rsquo;re used to doing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always use a stylus guard or record player dust cover when not using my decks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I regularly clean my stylus/needle either by blowing or (how you&rsquo;re supposed to do it) with a stylus cleaning brush.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I highly recommend you get one of these tracking weight scales: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Precise-Digital-Turntable-Backlight-Cartridge/dp/B08DKR87ZC/">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Precise-Digital-Turntable-Backlight-Cartridge/dp/B08DKR87ZC/</a>
and a small 10cm or so spirit level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are dealing with expensive records, records you care about, or records that you think one day might become expensive, I do think it is a worthwhile investment to get a set of good outer covers for the vinyl jackets and some good quality inner sleeves to replace the inner sleeves (often printed paper) that come with the record. You typically put the old sleeves next to the record in the outer sleeve so they don&rsquo;t get worn down by use. This will cut down the amount of dust and static that accumalates also. Take the digital download cards out of the records when you open them - if you leave them sealed with your record for years they can cause compression marks on the vinyl. I usually redeem them online once I buy the record and then rip up the digital download card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vinyl is an analogue medium. Occassionally things are going to go wrong - you&rsquo;re going to get some fluff on your stylus and the record will stop tracking properly, or the record is going to skip, or there will be crackling from surface noise, dust, dirt, whatever. You will have to take action, usually involing lifting the needle from the record, often in the middle of your set. Be prepared, but you can always remind the audience jokingly that you are actually playing real records - they will (hopefully) understand it&rsquo;s not like pressing a button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Needle drops. I do not recommend beginner DJs start dropping the needle manually onto their records. On every record deck there will be a lever that gently lowers the needle into position on the record, and raises it when reversed. It IS possible to bypass this and drop the needle manually and gently on the record without using the lever, and lots of very experienced DJs can do it so well that there is no long-term damage to the needle and they are faster and often more accurate than using the lever, but doing it this way there is much more of a risk when starting out that you will scratch your records. Scratch DJs and old timer vinyl DJs drop the needle all the time, and good for them. Until you are more used to everything I recommend you use the lever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight cases. You can get cheap second hand flightcases that have lasted decades and probably will last decades more. You&rsquo;re looking for something sturdy and mostly metal but as light as possible. Make sure there are no dents and the catches operate like they should, and your decks and mixer snugly fit in without any movement. Coffin style flightcases are a popular option for vinyl DJs as they reduce setup time, but they are pretty heavy. Remember to check with the venue how much space you will have and will they have a table or booth you can put your entire setup on. A lot of venues are used to much smaller controller setups so check first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record boxes/bags. There are lots of different options here. I would recommend a secondhand metal flightcase style record box which is as light as possible, opens up at the front so you have plenty of space to shuffle through the records, and has wheels and a handle so you can pull it around like a suitcase. A full record box can be VERY VERY heavy! Only take the ones you know are going to go down well. There is a lot less manouvering space in your set for real vinyl DJing as opposed to just turning up with a controller and 20k songs to choose from, so you have to plan things more. Get a good idea what type of music you are booked for, and what people are likely to like. Make sure the records you have are good quality and will not skip or cause you problems. Remember to keep records away from direct sunlight - they will warp. A good habit is to put them back in the box once you&rsquo;ve played them. They should always be kept standing up vertically, never stack them horizontally as the weight can cause problems for the bottom records. You may opt to leave behind all the outer sleeves and inlays etc and put each record in your record box only in a paper inner sleeve where you can write the artist, the track, the position on the record, and the BPM, and anything else you want to make selection easier. Colour coded stickers can be useful. Don&rsquo;t assume you will have light in a darkened environment to read your inner sleeves, and I wouldn&rsquo;t rely on your mobile phone torch - it uses up battery and you might need it for other things. You can get clip-on battery powered lights or keyring pencil torches that last for ages on a single battery.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="monthly-maintenance">Monthly Maintenance</h2>
<p>Once every month or so, I do this:</p>
<p>A) Check the spirit level on the platter of your turntable without a record, to make sure that from top to bottom, from left to right, and from the center to the outside of the platter, everything is stable. If anything is off, use the adjustable feet on your decks to make sure everything is level, or put some cut up cardboard under one of the legs to lift it, if you don&rsquo;t have adjustable feet.</p>
<p>B) Use the scale recommended above to check the tracking weight, again without a record on. Make sure it is within your cartridge acceptable weight range, but relatively low within that range unless you&rsquo;re doing a lot of scratching. Higher tracking weight = quicker burnout of needle and record, but closer tracking when you scratch.</p>
<p>C) If you are using DVS, use some vinyl record cleaner to clean the DVS timecode records you&rsquo;re using, and wipe them clean.</p>
<p>D) If you are using DVS, recalibrate the decks using the DVS software so that it uses the right sensitivity after any adjustments you have made.</p>
<p>E) Check all the connections on the back of your turntables, make sure they are tightly plugged in, occasionally they become loose over time and with knocks, and that can cause problems.</p>
<p>F) Check the speed of your platter is stable and spot on at different speeds - most OEM Technics style clones have a small strobe light and a number of dots. Learn how to use those to quickly check that all is in order.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all you need to do to make sure your equipment is reliable and lasts a long time.</p>

Plex Media Server - <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">https://www.plex.tv/</a> <strong>dbPoweramp CD Ripper</strong></p>
<p>I have found this to be the fastest and most reliable CD ripper. It is commercial but is a very small cost and contains access to a lot of metadata services. I rip all my CDs to FLAC.</p>
<p><strong>Bandcamp Collection Downloader</strong></p>
<p>This is so useful. It required a few tweaks to get to work reliably under Windows, and if you haven&rsquo;t got any scripting skills then it will be a pain, but it has been hugely useful in syncing my Bandcamp purchases, of which I have over 200. It checks whether it has downloaded a purchase before as well, so you don&rsquo;t need to re-download everything, just what has been added recently to your collection. I use the following settings in a batch file which works reliably. If you want to use it you will have to replace &lsquo;socialistsynthesis&rsquo; to be your bandcamp username. Remember to download the latest JDK NOT just the latest JRE otherwise it won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p><code>java -jar bandcamp-collection-downloader.jar -f=flac -j=1 -r=3 socialistsynthesis</code> <strong>Soulseek</strong></p>
<p>I make a genuinely huge attempt to purchase all the music I play for my stream. I have spent SO much money on digital and physical copies of music over the years. When something is not available for purchase, or I have an old MP3 rip from a CD and I want a FLAC, then I use Soulseek. Whether you do is up to you, just know that it is there.</p>
<p><strong>Beets.IO</strong></p>
<p>I use Beets.io to manage all tagging. It is extremely powerful if you are comfortable with the commandline. This is my current config:</p>

      <title>Resolume MIDI Control in my Twitch DJing Setup</title>

      <description>I have retired the Novation SL Zero Mk1 MIDI controller that was causing me a lot of grief when I was running Resolume and Ableton Live at the same time, as its Automap functionality was locking on to the Ableton Live mixer in session view now and then, and so, sometimes, when I thought I was controlling Resolumes visual FX, I was actually changing the volume faders in my DJ mix.</description>

<p>I have retired the Novation SL Zero Mk1 MIDI controller that was causing me a lot of grief when I was running Resolume and Ableton Live at the same time, as its Automap functionality was locking on to the Ableton Live mixer in session view now and then, and so, sometimes, when I thought I was controlling Resolumes visual FX, I was actually changing the volume faders in my DJ mix. Which was bad.</p>
<p>I have replaced it with the even older but classic Behringer BCF2000. I use the sliders to control the 8 dashboard visual FX controls on Resolume. I also have attached two pedals to the BCF2000. The first one, the sustain on/off switch pedal, I have mapped to control whether Resolume is running in autopilot mode or just looping the current visual. This will allow me to set it on autopilot through most of the set and then focus on one visual when I want to do some more involved stuff. The expression pedal, I have set to control the opacity of the top layer. I run Resolume with two layers, the main layer which is usually a background of an animation, and then the &rsquo;extra lines and bars and stuff on top&rsquo; layer. So when I gradually depress and release the expression pedal, I fade in and fade out the &rsquo;extra stuff&rsquo; layer from the scene.</p>
<p>I have additionally mapped four buttons on the Behringer BCF2000 to manually skip forward and backwards each layer through the prepared layer list. So if one layer is boring or I want to select something specific I have some control over that without having to open the Resolume window on the PC.</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;m happy with the autopilot setup I&rsquo;ve got. I want to spend more time on Resolume and the VJing side of my stream, but for now this will do and will offer sufficient variety.</p>

      <description>I recently found a good price on a Vestax VCM-600 controller. It is a specially made MIDI controller for Ableton Live, with the same build quality as a DJ mixer. It allows for control over 6 channels in the Ableton Live &amp;lsquo;session&amp;rsquo; view, which is arranged similarly to a mixing console. It also adds dozens of MIDI mappable DJ controls such as the traditional Hi, Mid and Lo EQs, a crossfader, a filter control, control over a lot of Ableton FX, and more.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hybridsetup.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>I recently found a good price on a Vestax VCM-600 controller. It is a specially made MIDI controller for Ableton Live, with the same build quality as a DJ mixer. It allows for control over 6 channels in the Ableton Live &lsquo;session&rsquo; view, which is arranged similarly to a mixing console. It also adds dozens of MIDI mappable DJ controls such as the traditional Hi, Mid and Lo EQs, a crossfader, a filter control, control over a lot of Ableton FX, and more. It has 6 channel faders + 2 send faders for FX. More info in this video:</p>
<p>[youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpZ7o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpZ7o</a>_H9u2M&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]</p>
<p>It replaces my Pioneer DJM-S3 mixer. I use a 4x4 interface compatible with Serato DJ Pro DVS, the Denon DS1, and run the timecode audio from the Reloop 8000Mk2 decks through the Denon DS1. It outputs the Serato DJ Pro modified audio for both decks. The outputs of the DS1 are connected via a Douk VU-Meter (to see the levels for both decks for accurate gain control while mixing) to the Behringer UMC1820 audio interface which is connected to my broadcast PC running Ableton.</p>
<p>When I move the faders on the Vestax VCM-600 controller attached to the broadcast PC, it functions as a DJ mixer, with the actual mixing taking place in Ableton through the UMC1820 audio interface.</p>
<p>The microphone for streaming is connected to the sound interface as usual, and the DJ headphones are connected to the headphone amp on the the sound interface, with mic levels and cueing dealt with via Ableton Live.</p>
<p>The advantages of this setup over my previous setup are multifold, as I now have a 6 channel fully configurable mixer. Firstly it will allow me to bring in various external hardware instruments such as drum machines, hardware synths etc, all controlled via Ableton. I could also bring in software instruments/VSTs. It would allow me to use high quality studio software FX in my DJ sets. It would also allow me to trigger samples from Ableton Live and have them output on one of the channels, synced to the beat.</p>
<p>I am currently using the 4-band X:One EQ filter Ableton FX Unit clone from <a href="https://tarekith.com/freestuff/">https://tarekith.com/freestuff/</a>, see: <a href="https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?t=144388">https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?t=144388</a> .
I am also using the <a href="https://xferrecords.com/freeware">https://xferrecords.com/freeware</a> DJM-900 filter clone. I have adapted these both into my Ableton VCM600 template set. I might release this set later once I&rsquo;ve built it up more with Ableton FX.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ableton-vcm600-set.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>I am currently using Serato DJ Pro FX controlled by my Akai SP8 cheap controller connected to my DJ laptop, which I have changed the knobs on to make them more tactile. I also have an Ableton Push mk1 controller hooked up to broadcast PC which is useful for multiple things, but mostly for quickly controlling Ableton Live without having to mess around with the mouse. I have not synced the BPM automatically yet between Serato and Ableton; Serato has a problem with Ableton Link integration I found. For the moment, I am using the Serato DJ Pro beat-synced FX on Serato, and using tap-tempo on my Ableton Push controller to set the BPM in Ableton Live. I don&rsquo;t need the BPM to be exact at the moment for Ableton Live as I am not using any beat-synced FX or looping FX on Ableton.</p>
<p>Looping, beat repeat, cue point jumping, tempo, sync, scratching and platter changes for each deck are handled by the controls on the Reloop 8000mk2 which are both connected via USB to Serato on the DJ laptop, so they function as a DVS system but with also pads and controls for Serato too.</p>
<p>I am using Resolume on my broadcast PC. I run a number of scenes on autopilot mode, and use the ancient Novation SL1 Mk1 MIDI controller to apply video FX to Resolume. I sync the BPM to Resolume through Ableton Link, with Ableton Live setting the BPM for Resolume through Ableton Link, and me setting the BPM for Ableton Live using the tap-tempo on the Ableton Push controller.</p>
<p>I have a sustain pedal which I use to trigger the &lsquo;ducking&rsquo; affect in Ableton when I want to talk over the music.. when the pedal is depressed, the music fades down and the mic up a bit, so people can hear me better. When the pedal is let go, the microphone volume is killed so no background noise is picked up.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dj-setup-21-4-2021.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Here it is in action - the clicks are me flipping the crossfader or the channel faders on the VCM-600:</p>
<p>[youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJs7rw7jDtQ&amp;w=560&amp;h=315">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJs7rw7jDtQ&amp;w=560&amp;h=315</a>]</p>
<p>As you can see from the video, the latency really isn&rsquo;t an issue. It&rsquo;s very responsive even though the timecode audio from the turntables is being processed by the Denon DS1, sent through the Douk VU-meter, and then converted to digital signals by the UMC1820 sound interface, sent through an EQ and FX chain, and mixed by Ableton according to the VCM600 DJ controller movements.</p>
<p>Here is a flowchart which should help explain the signal flow:
<img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dj-setup-flowchart.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Here is a list of equipment that I use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>VESTAX VCM-600 Ableton Controller. Came out in 2010, cannot buy anymore new. Bought second-hand for £175. Had to clean the knobs with isopropyl alcohol as the coating becomes sticky after years and years of use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Novation Remote Zero SL Controller. Very old MIDI controller, cannot buy anymore. Can buy very cheaply now. Not sure if I would buy this exact controller again but it certainly is durable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AKAI LPD8 Controller. Very cheap MIDI controller still being sold. Bought new for £30. Took the knobs off and replaced them with Doepfer knobs from my Eurorack for better grip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behringer UMC1820 Sound Interface. Very good value USB audio interface with lots of inputs and outputs. It comes with 8 physical inputs and 10 physical outputs. To get access to the other inputs and outputs you would need to buy an ADAT or SPDIF expander. Bought new for around £200.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Douk VU-Meter. Very cheap though accurate VU-meter for checking volume levels. Bought new for £60.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Denon DS1 Serato Interface. Not sold anymore, sadly, although it has a class-compliant driver for OSX so it is likely to remain suported for a while, while the alternative Rane Serato interfaces may not. Bought secondhand via Ebay for £120.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reloop 8000mk2 vinyl turntables. Excellent turntables with a huge amount of features and a solid build. They are available quite cheaply new. Paid around £400 each for them. I use Concorde Mk2 Digital needles and Serato Butterrug slipmats and Serato control vinyl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ableton Push Mk1 Controller. Although the MK2 is out, the MK1 is still supported and there is no indication it will be deprecated soon. Not available new anymore, buy secondhand. I paid £250 for mine although they&rsquo;re available much cheaper now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RODE Procaster Microphone, cage, pop sheild and boom mount - This is an excellent high quality microphone. You can get a lot cheaper if you wanted to. Mic setup cost about £200 new.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple Macbook Pro 2015 13&quot; Retina edition. Still going strong from when I bought it. Only has 8GB memory and that is shared with the graphics card, but otherwise it is fine. I have kept it on Mojave, no plans to update. I only use it with Serato DJ Pro. I have an external HD attached to it for all my DJ music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broadcast PC - a workstation PC I built myself. For the specs see: <a href="/my-computer-setup/">/my-computer-setup/</a>. In particular I have found the Nvidea 1080 graphics card very useful for Resolume - no way would it run well on my laptop.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For new equipment I use <a href="http://www.thomann.de">Thomann.de</a> often or <a href="http://www.dv247.com">DV247.com</a>, or Amazon, or whatever is cheaper on Google Shopping.
For used equipment I use <a href="http://www.reverb.com">Reverb.com</a> or <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk">Ebay.co.uk</a> or occasionally Facebook adverts.</p>

      <title>2020 Retrospective – Wow, what a year!</title>

      <description>I think, for obvious reasons, 2020 has been a year that no-one could really have expected. With COVID-19 and lockdown, a lot of things have changed, both in my life, in everyone&amp;rsquo;s lives, and in the workplace.
My online DJing setup
Things that went well I changed medication around March 2020 which has resulted in significant weight loss, as expected. The previous medication was making me put on and retain weight even when I was eating very very little.</description>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/background.jpg" type="" alt=""  />My online DJing setup</p>
<h2 id="things-that-went-well">Things that went well</h2>
<ul>
<li>I changed medication around March 2020 which has resulted in significant weight loss, as expected. The previous medication was making me put on and retain weight even when I was eating very very little. In March 2020 my weight was nearly 136KG and now it has gone down to 125KG in March 2021. I have not been doing more exercise, indeed quite a bit less, as I have been staying indoors most of the time. The weight loss has had a very good effect on my general health and my sleep.</li>
<li>I am much happier than this time last year. Working corporate jobs I found very very stressful and apart from being financially rewarding, I wasn’t getting much else out of it. My mental and physical health was suffering. My relationship with my wife and friends are much better now because I am less miserable all the time.</li>
<li>I have taken up DJing over the internet and have turned this into a part-time income. It is so much fun. I used to DJ in clubs in my 20s regularly and I didn’t realise how much I had missed it. It is great to have a way to connect socially with people in lockdown and people really appreciate my DJ sets, which is great.</li>
<li>Working from home has been a great change for me. Before the pandemic I wanted to work from home 100% anyway, because I was ending up spending at least 2 hours commuting to and from work, it was costing a lot (because I can’t drive) and it was taking up a lot of time and energy.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/wfh.jpg" type="" alt=""  />My work from home setup</p>
<h2 id="things-that-didnt-go-so-well">Things that didn’t go so well</h2>
<ul>
<li>I found that when I am working 100% from home, it is difficult to do work that I am not motivated to do. It is much easier to get things done that you really don’t enjoy when you are in the office. I have noticed a productivity decline in things I don’t really want to do, but I don’t think this is necessarily a problem with working from home, simply it is something I need to address by finding work I am more motivated to do.</li>
<li>My financial situation is a bit unsteady at the moment. I have got used to living on much less, and my costs are minimal. However I am struggling to find a job I am motivated to stick with. I think this simply requires me to explore careers and jobs outside of what I have done before.</li>

      <description>After the last post I have added Ableton Live and my Eurorack modular to my DJ setup, with a master clock being sent via MIDI cables from my Roland TR8 drum machine that syncs with Ableton. The drum machine also can be used creatively for drum fills etc.
I hope these two diagrams explain my setup adequately - sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words! The &amp;lsquo;actor&amp;rsquo; is me - I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a way to change that on http://draw.</description>

      <description>The classic!
Yes! Some people actually write and read BOOKS on DJing. As if YouTube wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough. Well it can be enough.. but YouTube is also a cess pit of rubbish information, and at least a book has a better chance of being properly edited and reviewed. Also reading a book makes you more intellectual. Which is utterly true.
So. I have been reading through these DJing books to see if they could teach me something I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about DJing after over 10 years doing it.</description>

<p>Yes! Some people actually write and read BOOKS on DJing. As if YouTube wasn&rsquo;t enough. Well it can be enough.. but YouTube is also a cess pit of rubbish information, and at least a book has a better chance of being properly edited and reviewed. Also reading a book makes you more intellectual. Which is utterly true.</p>
<p>So. I have been reading through these DJing books to see if they could teach me something I didn&rsquo;t know about DJing after over 10 years doing it. And there were quite a few interesting techniques and tricks that I learned from these.</p>
<p><strong>How to DJ (Properly) – Frank Broughton, Bill Brewster (2003)</strong></p>
<p>This is a great old book that I first bought when I was getting into DJing back around 2000. It covers so much technical and non-technical information that is still highly relevant today, but some parts are laughably out of date. I really wish they would update this book and put out a new version. A lot of the non-technical stuff you won’t find elsewhere and is really useful still. Definitely worth a read but don’t expect a modern take on things.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1889346.How_To_DJ_Properly_">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1889346.How_To_DJ_Properly_</a></p>
<p><strong>FutureDJs: How to DJ - Austen Smart, Scott Smart, Tom Dent</strong> <strong>(2019)</strong></p>
<p>This is the book you want if you want a modern and uptodate introduction to DJing. It was designed as a textbook to help train high school music teachers so they could include DJing tuition in their classrooms. It’s amazing – really great – and contains lots of diagrams which help the explanation. If you want to get just one book on DJing buy this.</p>
<p><a href="https://futuredjs.org/book/">https://futuredjs.org/book/</a></p>
<p><strong>Rock The Dancefloor: The proven five-step formula for total DJing success - Phil Morse (2016)</strong></p>
<p>I have to say straight away that I am quite biased as I don’t actually like Phil Morse of DigitalDJTips.com fame. I don’t find his reviews to be that accurate and often seem a bit like advertisements of products. I have learned some things from his website but not a huge amount. However this book has got lots of great reviews so I thought I’d mention it. I do have a copy but I found it a bit difficult to get through as it is all written in Phil’s quite conversational prose, with no diagrams or pictures or anything really to break it up. It may well be worth checking out to see if you can get anything from it though. I will probably try and get through it myself and give it a proper review, but just so you know it’s out there.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond Beatmatching: Take Your DJ Career to the Next Level - Yakov Vorobyev, Eric Coomes, Bill Murphy (2012)</strong></p>
<p>This is quite an interesting and quite advanced book by the developers of Mixed in Key. In it, they talk about using MIK’s features to detect musical key and energy level, and how you can use those features to plan your set around harmonic mixes and energy level arcs. It is quite advanced and very interesting. MIK is a pretty good piece of software, I have had it crash a few times when analysing very big libraries but generally it is pretty solid. I recommend checking this out, because although the basics of harmonic mixing are probably talked about in any recent DJing book, this goes into greater depth.</p>

      <title>Twitch Streaming Technical Setup</title>

      <description>I thought I’d write a bit here about my Twitch DJing setup and some of the hardware and software I’m using. Twitch streaming has become very popular over the lockdown period, and I think people might be interested in how I have configured my stream. Something that seperates my stream from anyone else I&amp;rsquo;ve seen on Twitch is that is that I do live vinyl DJing AND live VJing at the same time on my stream.</description>

</ul>
<p>I thought I’d write a bit here about my Twitch DJing setup and some of the hardware and software I’m using. Twitch streaming has become very popular over the lockdown period, and I think people might be interested in how I have configured my stream. Something that seperates my stream from anyone else I&rsquo;ve seen on Twitch is that is that I do live vinyl DJing AND live VJing at the same time on my stream. This is how I achieve it.</p>
<p><strong>Broadcast PC</strong></p>
<p>This is my main desktop PC that I use for personal use as well as streaming. It has a Nvidia 1080 graphics card which is very useful with Resolume Avenue, the VJing software I use. I have one main big monitor and one smaller second monitor which I have attached to a long HDMI cable and placed next to my DJing desk along with a second mouse and keyboard which goes into a USB 3.0 hub and a long USB 3.0 extension cable. When I go to DJ I set the Windows graphical settings to duplicate my screen on both screens, so I can control the broadcast computer from where I am standing next to my DJ equipment. I have a Behringer UMC1820 sound interface which has 8 balanced phono inputs. Inputs 5&amp;6 are permanently connected to my DJ mixer, and I use Input 1 for my microphone.</p>
<p><strong>Broadcasting Software</strong></p>
<p>I use Streamlabs OBS on my broadcast PC. I did initially subscribe so they let me download one of their custom themes, which I have heavily edited but still remains integral to my setup. For some reason even though my subscription has lapsed that has not made any difference to whether I can continue using this theme and the app, although it has turned my follow/subscription/bit notifications back to the plain old free ones. I prefer it over free OBS for three features at least.</p>
<p>Firstly, the studio mode – I am not sure if OBS free has this (maybe it does?) but it is useful when fixing things live to have two scenes active, one which is being broadcast and one which is only visible to me. Secondly, the way you can order the layers on the scene, this is very intuitive to me and was more intuitive than the layering (front to back) on OBS free. Thirdly, the remote control element.. I have a remote control app for my Android tablet and phone which allows me to quickly cycle through scenes – no need to shell out for fancy scene controllers.</p>
<p>I use the free NDI tools for NDI streams to Streamlabs OBS for the external video elements on my screen – one from Resolume Avenue on my broadcast PC and the second from my Macbook Pro which is running Serato Video. I also use streamelements and Moobot to enable kappagen effects, and to moderate the chat and provide information to chatters.</p>
<p><strong>Cameras</strong></p>
<p>2x Logitech C920 web cams on tripods. I bought them because I saw them used at the BBC where I used to work. I think if I had more USB3 ports on my computer the bandwidth for these cameras would be increased and the resolution would be wider, but as they are, they are really solid. I’ve only had occasional problems with the auto-focus when there is a lot of lighting strobing going on.</p>
<p><strong>DJing Equipment</strong></p>
<p>I have a pair of Reloop 8000mk2 turntables with a Pioneer DJM-S3 Serato mixer. Both integrate really well with Serato and offer additional performance features. I use Serato on my aging Macbook Pro 2015 and have actually got it to reliably output Serato Video using NDI capture tool and send it over the network to my broadcasting computer without the fan having to spin up. I only use Serato on my Macbook because I don’t want to burden it – it is doing enough as it is! I have a 2TB external HD where I put all my digital music files and have it mounted as a network share so I can transfer files over the network from my main PC. I use Mixed in Key to add Serato cue points to music I use, and the free MusicBrainz Picard to correctly tag files and organise my music collection.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong></p>
<p>I use Phillips Hue lightsources and the hyeDynamic Windows 10 app. It connects to the Hue hub strobes the lights in time with an audio input. I have a Hue Lightstrip and 4x Hue Colour bulbs and they all sync together. I also have a small laser unit that syncs in time with the beat and is useful as added background lighting.</p>
<p><strong>VJing</strong></p>
<p>I use Resolume Avenue with a number of clips I have commercially bought. I have it running mostly in autopilot mode with all the clips synced to the beat. The beat is provided by a free app called ‘AudioBoxBaby’ which I am really looking to replace, but there is simply nothing else out there on the market. It detects the approximate BPM of any audio coming in on my sound interface from my DJ mixer, and translates it into a single repeating midi note. This midi note I have mapped to the tap tempo button in Resolume so it is like a human tapping the tempo along with the music in theory. Serato DJ Pro supports Ableton Link, and so does Resolume Avenue, but I have found that syncing via Ableton Link to be very problematic when using Serato, and of course it doesn’t work when not using Serato, for example with all vinyl sets.</p>
<p>I also have a Novation Zero SL controller which I have had for over 10 years and still works perfectly, so I really recommend it! It is attached via a USB extension cable to my broadcasting PC and I use it to control some basic VJing effects that I put over the audiopilot clips to create buildups and visual changes in time with the music. It has 8 sliders and I move them in time with the beat or to create buildups/variations etc.</p>
<p><strong>Microphone/Voice</strong></p>
<p>I have a Rode Procaster mic with a Rode microphone boom, shock cage and pop shield, which is attached to my audio interface for my broadcasting PC with a long cable. I have it wired so that when I press a piano sustain pedal on the floor under my microphone, vocal ducking happens – e.g. the music fades down slightly and the microphone volume fades up so you can hear me talking over the music. In order to accomplish that I use two commercial apps, the first called ‘Auto-Duck in Real Time’ which allows me to configure the vocal ducking linked to a keyboard keypress, and ‘Bome’s MIDI Translator Classic’ which when the MIDI signal that is generated when I press the sustain pedal connected to my Novation Zero SL controller, the MIDI translator converts it into a keypress that is picked up by the ‘Auto-Duck in Real Time’ app to trigger vocal ducking.  I have it configured so while I am holding down the sustain pedal, it ducks the music playing and when I release it, the music goes back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Connection</strong></p>
<p>I have a fast Virgin Media internet connection with 30mbits/second upload. I think my Twitch stream and everything else in my home requires about 5mbits/sec upload! I also have a backup internet fibre DSL connection that thankfully I have never had to use when I’m streaming, but it also has around 15mbits/second upload and I should be able to switch between both relatively quickly if I needed to.</p>
<p>Phew! That’s all! :) I realise it is technically involved compared to a lot of peoples setups, but I have always been really interested in the technical side and have been lucky enough to be able to create exactly the setup that I really wanted for my stream. If you&rsquo;re interested in checking it out, my regular stream is from 4PM UK time/UTC every Sunday and I play for at least 4 hours. Follow me on Twitch at: <a href="http://twitch.tv/djdavidcraddock">http://twitch.tv/djdavidcraddock</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Struggling with the technical side? If you are interested in hiring me to help develop your own streaming setup, I have worked before in this capacity and can supply excellent references. The work can be done online, as with your permission I can remote control your computer and configure things. Please <a href="/contact/">send me a message if you are interested via the contact form</a> on this website.</p>

      <description>Journalism has deteriorated to a huge degree in the online age. A lot of articles and video content are one-sided short ‘clickbait’ – short messages designed to trigger an extreme emotional reaction. ALMOST ALL journalism is like this these days, it doesn’t matter if you have a highly established news network you have been trusting for decades, they have all had to adopt this low-quality strategy due to the ultra-competitive and dire financial situation that all news reporting finds itself in.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Journalism has deteriorated to a huge degree in the online age. A lot of articles and video content are one-sided short ‘clickbait’ – short messages designed to trigger an extreme emotional reaction. ALMOST ALL journalism is like this these days, it doesn’t matter if you have a highly established news network you have been trusting for decades, they have all had to adopt this low-quality strategy due to the ultra-competitive and dire financial situation that all news reporting finds itself in. However a lot of people still take news content at complete face value, and this leads to a huge number of people being misled about the real facts.</p>
<p>So, whenever you are reading, listening to, or watching a piece of news content, here are some questions you can ask yourself to really get the full picture of what you are consuming.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How long is this news article/segment? What depth does it go into? Broadsheets like the New York Times go into much more depth than a 10 second ‘news highlights’ clip, and will usually present a much more detailed and extensive argument. If you really want to understand something, as the saying goes, read a book - or better yet, several books from several different perspectives. Do not expect to understand the full issue from TV news segments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What emotional reaction is the journalist trying to get me to feel? What language does the piece use, what quotes are they using, what video are they using, what music do they use to set the scene, is the news anchor looking like they are being particularly dramatic? What is the emotional message?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the editorial slant of the news source? EVERY news source has an editorial voice – or bias – and you need to take that into account when getting your news from that source. It doesn’t matter if you generally agree with the editorial voice, you have to understand that everything is biased. News isn’t free and a lot of news sources get their funding from various ‘benefactors’ who often have a very real say on their editorial bias. Knowing how the news organisation is funded is very important in knowing what slant they will take, especially when it relates to political news.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the news piece provide a fair and plausible representation of both sides? There are ALWAYS two sides to the story, this is something that has been all but extinguished in modern news reporting. A few news sources will set up often comic ‘straw men’ opposition points, like the BBC interviewing odd people who drink their own urine for a news piece on how health information is understood by the public. While this may be amusing, it is not meant to present a fair and accurate argument from both sides, it is designed to ridicule one side. There are usually some genuine points from each side that are worth everyone considering, no matter what story it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek out contrary points and opposition points of view. If you want to understand a news event further, seek out a number of different articles from respectable sources with very different editorial voices/biases. Even when you take into account their individual biases, there are usually some valid points underneath it all.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that everyone will consider thinking more criticially about the news they consume.</p>

I have filled up the third - and surely last, as there is no more room in the studio! - case. I started this Eurorack modular in 2015.. so I am glad it is all complete now. I put in a small amount nearly every month for new modules.</description>

<p>So.. finally my 27U Eurorack modular synthesiser is complete. I have filled up the third - and surely last, as there is no more room in the studio! - case. I started this Eurorack modular in 2015.. so I am glad it is all complete now. I put in a small amount nearly every month for new modules. I am not some &lsquo;rich kid&rsquo; who could afford to buy everything at once - and indeed I think my gradual approach has benefitted the overall modular because it&rsquo;s made me think about what I actually need, and given me time to learn as I go along.</p>
<p>These are the details for the (newest) left section case:</p>

      <description>In our house, seperate to my main PC (see the tab above) we still have two Ivy Bridge-based PCs:
Conny&amp;rsquo;s PC
i7-3770K 16GB DDR3 RAM Nvidea Radeon 970 Graphics Card 250 GB SSD Windows 10 My wife uses this as her main PC, and plays quite a few games with it. For a CPU and motherboard that I put together in 2011 or so, I am quite amazed it still runs adequetely!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our house, seperate to my main PC (see the tab above) we still have two Ivy Bridge-based PCs:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AQXobsZHNg&amp;t=212s"><strong>Conny&rsquo;s PC</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>i7-3770K</li>
<li>16GB DDR3 RAM</li>
<li>Nvidea Radeon 970 Graphics Card</li>
<li>250 GB SSD</li>
<li>Windows 10</li>
</ul>
<p>My wife uses this as her main PC, and plays quite a few games with it. For a CPU and motherboard that I put together in 2011 or so, I am quite amazed it still runs adequetely! It runs the games she wants to play, the most graphically intensive being Deadpool, but it will also cope with Borderlands 2, Skyrim Special Edition, Shadow Warrior 2, and others. She is not interested in the top graphics games, but it runs just fine.</p>
<p>My Second PC</p>
<p>I have a computer that I use for my own programming and tech hobby projects. It used to be a top of the range workstation 2011 and I got it in a hardware disposal sale at Arm Ltd for only £400 in 2019. This is quite the deal, as it included a lisence for Windows 10 (normally costs £100 on its own).</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Xeon E5 2650 v2 8 CPU cores @ 2.60GHz</li>
<li>32.0GB DDR3 RAM</li>
<li>2048MB ATI AMD Radeon R9 200</li>
<li>250GB SSD</li>
<li>3TB HD</li>
<li>Windows 10</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need a powerful graphics card as I don&rsquo;t game on it, and the Radeon R9 3200 supports my 2560x1440px monitor so it is more than adequete. I have installed VMWare on it and am looking to spin up some virtual machines as servers, and have them running in the background while I am browsing. I could assign several cores and quite a lot of the RAM and not really notice a difference with the light work I do when using the computer.</p>
<p>I am just amazed at how much you can do with these old high-end CPUS. The performance delta between these Ivy Bridge 2011 CPUs today&rsquo;s processors really isn&rsquo;t that large, and they are so cheap these days. This following video shows just how cheap you can build one of these setups, and how powerful they are even today:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AQXobsZHNg&amp;t=212s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AQXobsZHNg&amp;t=212s</a></p>
<p>The only situation where these processors don&rsquo;t really work hugely well is in applications which emphasise single-core performance - I tried to use my second PC as an Ableton Live machine, and a lot of audio plugins I wanted to use were not optimised for multi-core processors, just single-core, so that didn&rsquo;t work well.</p>

      <description>I have made some considerable modifications to my modular since my last post. I have a 4-voice polyphony setup now with multiple voice Osc, VCA, Envelope and MIDI-CV modules, allowing me to experiment with polyphony voicing.
Elsewhere, I have added an Access Virus C synthesizer to my studio, and now have rack-mounted Behringer Model D and Emu Orbit 9090 synthesizers. I have also upgraded to Ableton 10 and use NI&amp;rsquo;s Komplete suite including Massive X, plus TAL-NO-UX Juno 106 softsynth, Sylenth1 and others.</description>

      <description>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d update my blog to reflect recent changes in my life, and review what was good and bad about them, as I was doing before.
The &amp;ldquo;Not Awesome&amp;rdquo;
My overall health level has got a bit worse over the years. I have had limited success in losing weight. I was going for regular walks nearly every week with a friend of mine, but that has stopped lately. I find it difficult exercising while living in a city, as my favourite activity for excercising is walking, and there are not a huge amount of pleasent walking oppertunities around my area.</description>

<p><strong>The &ldquo;Not Awesome&rdquo;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>My overall health level has got a bit worse over the years. I have had limited success in losing weight. I was going for regular walks nearly every week with a friend of mine, but that has stopped lately. I find it difficult exercising while living in a city, as my favourite activity for excercising is walking, and there are not a huge amount of pleasent walking oppertunities around my area. I have been getting Ubers to parks and walking there. A posssible solution that I am actually considering is moving outside of the city, where there are a lot more pleasent walking oppertunities on my doorstep, and which would hopefully lead to a much more active lifestyle.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The &ldquo;Awesome&rdquo;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Conny and I got married! We have also adopted two cats, so we have a little family now :)</li>
<li>Brexit is not going to affect Conny&rsquo;s ability to live and work in the UK after all, which is a great relief.</li>
<li>I am doing well in my job, having achieved a &ldquo;High Performing&rdquo; overall performance rating at work for this year. This has taken a huge amount of personal effort.</li>
<li>I have cutout meat from my diet for health reasons, although I&rsquo;m still eating fish. I have also started getting prepared healthy dinner meals from this site online. The meals are a lot more healthy than what I was eating before, plus it saves Conny from having to cook for me in the evening, which is good as she is currently working two jobs.</li>
<li>Conny has started work and is really enjoying it.</li>
<li>Our finances are looking much more healthy than in previous years, with Conny starting working and due to bonuses in my current job. I have increased contributions for my pension, and we are doing very well with budgeting and financial planning.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve managed to build up my music studio and gaming PC setup quite a bit, which was always something I wanted to do after taking on a more stressful (and rewarding) job.</li>
<li>Our house price has gone up a lot.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve developed a much healthier attitude to my professional skills and development, after reading the &lsquo;Passionate Programmer&rsquo; <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6399113-the-passionate-programmer">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6399113-the-passionate-programmer</a>. I have been putting in extra time after work to read a number of books and developing my technical skills.</li>
<li>I have started learning maths in my spare time through enlisting one of Conny&rsquo;s friends who is also math tutor. Building up my math skills will unlock a lot of interesting paths for my software development skills, such as audio DSP, graphics programming, and data science.</li>
<li>I have taken up record and CD collecting, and have quite a large collection of electronic music on vinyl and CD now. I bought a Rega Planar 1 turntable and two CDJ1000s with a pioneer mixer for DJing. I can connect the setup to Serato on my laptop for digital DJing too.</li>

      <description>I have been gradually adding parts to my PC so that it functions better for watching movies and gaming. Here are the components that I have used:
Monitor – BenQ EX3501R 35″ Ultra WQHD Curved Monitor This monitor is great for watching movies and gaming as it is ultra-wide at an aspect radio of 21:9, 3440x1440, a VA panel with high contrast, and the monitor is slightly curved so that you get a cinematic experience.</description>

<p>This monitor is great for watching movies and gaming as it is ultra-wide at an aspect radio of 21:9, 3440x1440, a VA panel with high contrast, and the monitor is slightly curved so that you get a cinematic experience.</p>

<p>This is a good set of 5.1 surround sound speakers with a separate subwoofer. I connect it from my motherboard’s optical out via ADAT for the best connection. I have the rear speakers mounted on the wall behind me, and the front speakers on the desk in front of me angled towards my seat.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/speakers.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<h3 id="phillips-hue-bulbs-and-dynamic-lighting">Phillips Hue Bulbs and Dynamic Lighting</h3>
<p>I have three <a href="https://www.philips.co.uk/c-m-li/hue">Phillips Hue</a> bulbs near the monitor which I have added to a ‘ <a href="https://www2.meethue.com/en-gb/support/entertainment">Hue Entertainment Group</a>’ which means their colours can be rapidly changed with applications that use the Phillips Hue Entertainment API. One such application is ‘ <a href="https://www.huedynamic.com/">hueDynamic for Hue</a>’ which is a Windows 10 application that monitors the colours on the pixels at the edges of the monitor, and changes the lights next to each edge according to the colours on that edge. This means I can have some dynamic lighting when watching movies.</p>
<h3 id="source-of-4k-video">Source of 4K Video</h3>
<p>Even though my monitor doesn’t quite support 4K, using <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.en-GB.html">VLC</a> means I can adjust the aspect ratio so that it will re scale the 4K video onto the monitor’s 3440x1440 dimensions, making 4K the best fit for my monitor. However my wireless connection is not currently fast enough to stream 4K video, so I use the ‘ <a href="https://www.4kdownload.com/products/product-videodownloader">4K Video Downloade</a> r’ app to download free 4K videos from YouTube so I can play them on VLC.</p>
<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h3>

<p>So, I download 4K videos from Youtube, play them on VLC which adjusts the 4K content to fit my monitor. The audio goes to my surround sound setup which creates a virtualised surround sound output to my speakers, and the hueDynamic app running in the background on my PC samples the colours are the left and right areas of my monitor, and dynamically changes the colour of the Hue bulbs as the video plays. This creates an immersive &lsquo;Home Cinema&rsquo; experience.</p>

      <description>Finally I have finished my Eurorack synthesiser! And I know many people say that &amp;lsquo;Euroracks are never finished&amp;rsquo; but this one absolutely has to be, for financial reasons. I think that I have got to a place where I have every major feature common in most synthesisers, but in a modular instrument format. It is a great place to learn about different synthesis techniques.

      <title>Finished Planning My Eurorack Modular Synthesizer</title>

      <description>In January 2015 I put in an order for my first Eurorack case. Little did I know that I would end up filling that case and buying a larger one. Finally, 2 years and 3 months later, I have nearly finished assembling what will be the complete Eurorack. I have been buying a module or two per month, researching what I need and playing a lot with what I have got already to find out its limitations and areas for possible expansion.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In January 2015 I put in an order for my first Eurorack case. Little did I know that I would end up filling that case and buying a larger one. Finally, 2 years and 3 months later, I have nearly finished assembling what will be the complete Eurorack. I have been buying a module or two per month, researching what I need and playing a lot with what I have got already to find out its limitations and areas for possible expansion. It&rsquo;s much like incrementally building and upgrading a gaming PC really, although with very different results.</p>
<p>Today I have come up with a final plan for what the cases will contain. The picture below is slightly misleading, I have two cases, so the case below is actually split down the middle into two enclosures. The left-side case is 2/3rds the size of the right hand case, that is why there is a grey unusable area at the top left.</p>
<p>With the purchase of 4 modules this month, I&rsquo;m nearly at the end. The remaining 3 modules will be bought and installed over the next month or two, depending on budget.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/screen-shot-2017-04-16-at-22-58-16.png" type="" alt="Screen Shot 2017-04-16 at 22.58.16.png"  /></p>
<p>In addition to the Eurorack modular, I also have a polyphonic MIDI-&gt;CV converter called the CV.OCD which plugs into the modular, a Nord Drum semi-modular analogue drum synthesizer, which also plugs in and allows me to make and play drum sounds, a Korg SQ1 sequencer which allows me to add 2x8 step sequencers to the mix, a MS20 Mini semi-modular synthesizer and a keyboard controller which allows me to play notes and chords on the whole damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>I have built a synth roughly around three goals. The first is keeping a traditional &lsquo;East Coast&rsquo; 3 voice subtractive synthesiser format, e.g. 3 oscillators, 3 filters, 3 envelopes, lots of LFOs and modulation, 3 VCAs, mixers, an FX unit including delay, reverb and others, 4x8 step sequencers which can be chained together (plus the 2x8 step in the SQ1). The second is that I wanted 3 voice polyphony - not &rsquo;true&rsquo; analogue polyphony because that is difficult to achieve - but 3 of everything, wired together with a polyphonic MIDI -&gt; CV controller, allowing me to play chords and experiment with traditional musical structures. The third goal was to keep the cost down! I am really not one of these modular synth heads with a huge studio and a near infinite budget, I have a lot of financial outgoings which I have met while building this. Building a modular synthesizer is never really &lsquo;cheap&rsquo; in any sense of the word I would use, but this is definitely a lot cheaper than many other modulars I&rsquo;ve seen, without compromising on quality.</p>
<p><strong>What I have Learnt</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Modular synthesizers <strong>can</strong> be built on a relatively low budget to achieve a good result.</li>
<li>I have sold all but one of my other synthesizers that I had before starting this project, finding the modular approach much more fun and rewarding then the in-the-box techniques and non-modular hardware synths.</li>
<li>Ignore what others might term as &lsquo;conventional wisdom&rsquo; in building a modular, the freedom of Eurorack is that you can build whatever you want, and exactly what you want, so go with what works for you.</li>
<li>Slowly building up a modular synthesizer is likely to be much better than buying everything at once, you will experiment with what you&rsquo;ve got, and learn its limitations and that will guide your purchases. It is impossible (in my opinion) to truly know what you want before you have started.</li>
<li>Use Modulargrid.net to plan out your synthesizer. It is very useful and has a huge database of modules. You can rearrange modules countless times on Modulargrid before you do it in reality, so you can plan and achieve a productive workflow.</li>

      <guid>http://davidcraddock.net/2017/02/27/goals-for-2017/</guid>
      <description>Looking at my past posts, you may notice that I didn&amp;rsquo;t set myself any goals for 2016. Looking back, this was a mistake, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to remedy this by setting some for 2017.
Goals:
Lose a significant amount of weight - this is very important for health reasons. Study maths courses - I intend to sign up for some maths courses at the OU. This will improve my mathematical knowledge, allowing for further study in subjects I&amp;rsquo;m interested in, plus allow me to work in more mathematically-heavy careers.</description>

<p>Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lose a significant amount of weight - this is very important for health reasons.</li>
<li>Study maths courses - I intend to sign up for some maths courses at the OU. This will improve my mathematical knowledge, allowing for further study in subjects I&rsquo;m interested in, plus allow me to work in more mathematically-heavy careers. This equates to 10 hours study per week, so it&rsquo;s not a light commitment, but one I think I need to make.</li>
<li>Exercise more - this is important as it improves my mindset, stamina, and makes me feel good.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not too many goals this time, but some important ones, and I think I&rsquo;m in a good position to commit to these thanks to the support of my partner, and therefore I am in a position to improve my life.</p>
<p>Will post updates at some point during the year to chart this progress.</p>

      <description>With my current setup, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make as much music &amp;lsquo;out of the box&amp;rsquo; as possible, away from the computer as I find it more fun.
Synths: KORG Minilogue: I use this for a keyboard controller, and I use the 16 step sequencer to run simple sequences. It connects to the PC via USB and has MIDI output. I can also use this as a synthesizer its own right, it&amp;rsquo;s good for backing chords and pads.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With my current setup, I&rsquo;m trying to make as much music &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; as possible, away from the computer as I find it more fun.</p>
<p><strong>Synths:</strong> <em>KORG Minilogue</em>: I use this for a keyboard controller, and I use the 16 step sequencer to run simple sequences. It connects to the PC via USB and has MIDI output. I can also use this as a synthesizer its own right, it&rsquo;s good for backing chords and pads.
<em>KORG MS20 Mini</em>: I&rsquo;m borrowing this from a friend. I will use it as a bass synth mostly. I&rsquo;ve got a Harvestman English Tear module which connects it to my Eurorack.</p>
<p><strong>Effects:</strong> <em>Electro Harmonix Stereo Memory Man with Hazarai</em>: This is an effects pedal with reverb and delay, which I use to add a bit of effects to modular synthesizer before I record. I will also use effects within Ableton, but I like the sound of this pedal in general.</p>
<p><strong>Drum Machine:</strong> <em>Nord Drum Mk1</em>: This accepts triggers from the Eurorack I&rsquo;ve recently discovered, so I have a drum machine that I can connect up to the Eurorack with 4 different drum voices.</p>
<p><strong>Modular:</strong></p>
<p>This is equivalent to a fairly standard three oscilator synth, with ring-mod, S&amp;H and noise out. I have a few different filters, an XPander style filter, an &rsquo;extreme&rsquo; filter which is loosely modelled on the MS20 filter, and a triple resonance filter which I use for noise soundscapes. It has two envelopes, and a Make Noise Maths and a Serge VCS equivalent for some modulation madness. It also has a 16 step sequencer.</p>

<p><strong>Workflow:</strong></p>
<p>I still use Ableton Live as a midi sequencer, creating midi clips for drums and the hardware synths. I will build up a patch on the synth, tweaking until it sounds servicable, then make a midi clip, record some loops from the synths, and cut up and move the audio around to compose a track. I might add some soft-synths and effects such as reverb and delay on the PC and mix the track. Then I will upload it to soundcloud and show it to musically minded friends. Depending on what they say, I may tweak the track and upload it again. This whole process usually is done within the space of a day or two, I sometimes spend longer for tracks that I want to be more finished and professional, but I am not really usually making music for more than a few people at the moment, so I don&rsquo;t spend ages finetuning each track.</p>

      <description>When I first started getting into computer roleplaying games in the 90s/00s I remember playing the Infinity Engine games by Bioware and Black Isle, such as Baldur’s Gate 2, the original Fallout games, and of course Planescape: Torment. It was the quality of writing that drew me in and took me to another world, the graphics were just a background setting to that writing.
Somewhere in the 2000s RPGs became more action orientated and prioritised mechanics and visual appeal and combat over branching stories.</description>

<p>When I first started getting into computer roleplaying games in the 90s/00s I remember playing the Infinity Engine games by Bioware and Black Isle, such as Baldur’s Gate 2, the original Fallout games, and of course Planescape: Torment. It was the quality of writing that drew me in and took me to another world, the graphics were just a background setting to that writing.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the 2000s RPGs became more action orientated and prioritised mechanics and visual appeal and combat over branching stories. Nowadays a lot of popular RPGs are those such as Dark Souls, which seem more about combat and atmosphere than anything else. Blockbuster games such as Dragon Age: Inquisition and The Witcher 3 still show that great writing, characterisation and real player choices can still be popular.</p>
<p>I still prefer the classic RPGs of yesteryear, those with mountains of dialogue and that take direct influence from fantasy novels and pen and paper, Dungeons and Dragons type games, which I grew up with. Here are some games which capture some of that great writing for me, although some are more interactive fiction than technically RPGs:</p>
<p><strong>80 Days</strong>
You are the butler of Philleas Fogg, the man Jules Verne writes about in ‘Around the World in 80 Days’. Your task is to choose how to get around the world not more than 80 days, as you plan routes between cities, buy and sell items and manage the finances of the trip. It really captures a sense of adventure in the world, and builds on Jules Verne’s steampunk theme as you encounter fantastical means of transport such as mechanical ostriches, airships and others. Every route is different and you can choose how the story unfolds by selecting different actions your character will take. The writing is the best I’ve ever seen in a mainstream game.</p>
<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/381780/">http://store.steampowered.com/app/381780/</a> <strong>Sunless Sea</strong>
In this game which also takes influence from Jules Verne, the city of London has fallen through the crust of the earth into hell, where there is a giant underwater cavern called the Underzee. You sail across this underground sea, exploring islands and immersing yourself in this Vernesque/Victorian/Lovecraftian setting. The writing again is amazing; it reads like poetry.</p>
<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/304650">http://store.steampowered.com/app/304650</a> <strong>Torment: Tides of Numenera</strong>
Another outlandish game, this time set in the world of Monte Cook’s Numenera, the writer behind the Planescape world which Planescape: Torment was set in. It hasn’t fully been realised yet but this game in early access form is already weird and wonderful, and much more interesting to me than yet another copy of on the elves and dwarves Tolkien formulaic settings.</p>

      <description>So.. the problem, as so many people have said, with getting into building a Eurorack modular synthesizer is that it becomes addictive, and you inevitably spend more than you can really afford. That said.. I now have a great fully customised synthesiser for what I want to do :) The layout is:
Top shelf: 3 oscilators and noise generator in the top left, 4 VCAs and S&amp;amp;H and Ring Mod sections in the mid center, LFOs in the top right.</description>

<p>Envelopes in the bottom left, Voltage Controlled Slew Generator and Make Noise&rsquo;s Maths in the center left, center right is my trigger sequencer setup from LADIK, bottom right is attenuators and linear and exponential mixers.</p>

      <description>These functions are quite handy, and allow you to do things such as copy and paste errors and google for them without having to manually open a browser. You have to enclose arguments to both functions in single quotes, e.g. &amp;lsquo;chrome &amp;lsquo;http://www.google.co.uk&amp;rsquo; and google &amp;lsquo;one two three four&amp;rsquo;. You should add these to your config file at ~/.config/fish/config.fish and make sure Google Chrome is already installed.

      <description>More adventures with Fish shell. I have scripted the generation of a bunch of test asset audio files in mp4 format suitable for dash streaming. I have used the audio file commandline tools ffmepg MP4Box and sox in this script, they are pretty powerful and worth installing via homebrew on OSX.
Thoughts: I think that instead of quoting you can just output $variable, which is probably better coding style. I&amp;rsquo;m still working out good way to return variables from functions, it seems that you need to echo out the output and that gets picked up by the calling function, which is a bit messy.</description>

      <description>For my own benefit as much as anyone elses, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d document my PC audio setup. I have two soundcards and two sets of speakers, one surround soundcard and speaker set for gaming and watching surround sound movies, and one audio interface linked up to my studio monitor speakers for music production. I also have a Digi 002 mixer which I use to mix in the outputs from my synthesisers to my recording interface.</description>

I have two soundcards and two sets of speakers, one surround soundcard and speaker set for gaming and watching surround sound movies, and one audio interface linked up to my studio monitor speakers for music production. I also have a Digi 002 mixer which I use to mix in the outputs from my synthesisers to my recording interface. When I want to record, I usually record one track at a time from a synthesier to the audio input of the audio interface, via the Digi 002 mixer:</p>

<p>These are the audio cables needed for this setup, some of which I will need to order in shorter sizes than the 3m ones I already have, to reduce cable clutter:</p>
<p>single phono to phono
2x phono to 2x phono
single phono to phono
single 3.5mm jack to phono
single 3.5mm jack to phono
2x phono to 2x phono

      <description>A few months ago I switched across from Bash onto the Fish shell, on my main development machine. I can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of its fast autosuggestions and its sane scripting language. Compared to Bash it is very fun to use.
Today I wrote a script to automate the backup of my development workspace onto a private bitbucket account. Bitbucket is good because it allows unlimited private repositories, but it caps the size of these repos at 2GB max, with some features disabled after 1GB.</description>

<p>A few months ago I switched across from Bash onto the <a href="http://fishshell.com/">Fish shell</a>, on my main development machine. I can&rsquo;t get enough of its fast autosuggestions and its sane scripting language. Compared to Bash it is very fun to use.</p>
<p>Today I wrote a script to automate the backup of my development workspace onto a private bitbucket account. Bitbucket is good because it allows unlimited private repositories, but it caps the size of these repos at 2GB max, with some features disabled after 1GB. This means that I want to find out the size of my repo before automatically backing it up. This script does this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>#!/usr/bin/env fish
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>set size (du -sm . | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>echo &#34;Workspace is $size MB&#34;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>if math &#34;$size &gt; 1000&#34;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  echo &#34;Workspace too big to commit!&#34;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  exit
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>else
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  echo &#34;Workspace is under 1GB, OK to commit&#34;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>end
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git add .
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git commit -m &#34;Automated backup&#34;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git push origin master
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Each individual directory additionally usually has its own git config which is synced to the separate repos for the code I&rsquo;m actually working on. But if my development machine is stolen or somehow destroyed, or I want to quickly replicate my environment on another machine with access to the original repos, then I can regenerate the associations between the different directories. It also makes me mindful of not committing images or other video assets.</p>

      <title>ADAT with Digi 002 Consoles - Don&#39;t throw them away just yet!</title>

      <description>So I got given a Digi 002 console version, which looks like this:
A fairly old style digital audio interface and mixer, which was all the rage back in 2002 when it first came out, but now is often found sitting in the skip. Why? Because it is a Pro-Tools inteface, and Avid stopped supporting it about 5 years ago, so it won&amp;rsquo;t actually work under Pro Tools and Windows 10 (believe me, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I got given a Digi 002 console version, which looks like this:</p>
<p>A fairly old style digital audio interface and mixer, which was <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec02/articles/digi002.asp">all the rage back in 2002</a> when it first came out, but now is often found sitting in the skip. Why? Because it is a Pro-Tools inteface, and Avid stopped supporting it about 5 years ago, so it won&rsquo;t actually work under Pro Tools and Windows 10 (believe me, I&rsquo;ve tried!). It only works as a recording interface through Pro Tools, so you can&rsquo;t just connect it via firewire to your PC and expect it to work.</p>
<p>It does have a stand-alone mode though, which allows you to use it as an analogue mixer, and that is pretty useful in itself if you want to drive monitors or record things from the master out. However after digging around on internet forums for a while, I figured out a way of actually using it as a recording interface! This is through use of the ADAT output, allowing you to plug it into a ADAT capable soundcard and record seperate channels over optical.</p>
<p>Caveats: it has to be 44.1khz sample rate, and you still have to use the Digi 002&rsquo;s analogue to digital coverters in the chain, which are pretty old now!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to live with this, and I was considering what the console cost me, you get an extra 8 audio input channels in your soundcard! Well worth the effort I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>To set it up with my Focusrite Sapphire 24 Pro, <a href="http://us.focusrite.com/answerbase/how-to-connect-an-octopre-mk-ii-to-a-saffire-pro-40-via-adat">I followed the following advice from the Focusrite forum</a>. This should work on most of the Sapphire range of soudcards.</p>

      <title>A Basic Eurorack Technique</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2016/01/24/my-basic-eurorack-technique/</link>

      <description>I thought it might be of some interest to describe how I use my Eurorack, at lot of the time, in making tracks. I have a 3 oscilator - 3 VCA - 3 filter Eurorack which I use primarily so that the oscilators initially work in unison mode with some slight detuning. I typically use a single loop, arpeggio or pattern that I repeat over the song. Then, partway through a track, I will transpose the octaves of the oscilators and vary the sustain of the envelopes, along with the filters and pulse-width modulation amount, to make a morphing yet harmonious sound texture progression.</description>

      <title>Goals of 2015 Summary</title>

      <guid>http://davidcraddock.net/2016/01/17/2015-goals-summary/</guid>
      <description>At the start of 2015, I wrote down some goals for 2015. Around half-way through the year, I revisited these goals with some thoughts on how well I&amp;rsquo;d done. Now 2015 is over, I want to reflect on what has been achieved and what hasn&amp;rsquo;t.
I also want to comment on the fact that I am discussing personal things here. A few years ago I was decided that I was going to keep this blog professional and pretty much dry of any thoughts or feelings on my personal life.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the start of 2015, I wrote down <a href="http://www.davidcraddock.net/2015/01/17/goals-for-the-year-2015/">some goals for 2015</a>. Around half-way through the year, I revisited these goals with <a href="http://www.davidcraddock.net/2015/09/01/goals-for-the-year-2015-midway-update/">some thoughts on how well I&rsquo;d done</a>. Now 2015 is over, I want to reflect on what has been achieved and what hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I also want to comment on the fact that I am discussing personal things here. A few years ago I was decided that I was going to keep this blog professional and pretty much dry of any thoughts or feelings on my personal life. I have moved away from that though, inspired by blogs such as <a href="http://www.cubicgarden.com">Iain&rsquo;s</a>, where personal thoughts and feelings are mixed with technical observations. I would like to think that this isn&rsquo;t a bad move; after all if potential employers come to look at this 5 years from now, and don&rsquo;t like what I&rsquo;ve done here, then I probably don&rsquo;t want to work for them anyway. There is the argument that blogs should be &rsquo;themed&rsquo; or targetted towards a particular subject to garner followers, and that too much sharing is possibly a bad thing. However, my current thoughts are that dry techncial info is boring, and I&rsquo;d rather mix it with other things that are important to me.</p>
<h3 id="retrospective-for-2015">Retrospective for 2015</h3>
<p>With that said.. 2015 was an eventful year, some things were awesome, some not.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Not Awesome&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mum started treatment for cancer, which is a non-curable kind, Myeloma. The treatment was a success and she is currently in remission for the time being, so that is a good thing, but how long she will stay in remission we do not know. Both my remaining grandparents also sadly passed away. I also split up with my girlfriend of 5 years, which was difficult and still haunts me to a certain degree.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Awesome&rdquo;</p>
<p>The money that my parents were going to put towards the wedding of the ex-girlfriend, they gave to me so I could put a deposit down on a house. So in August I bought and moved into a house in Withington, which I am in the process of doing up. It is <em>incredibly</em> cheap to buy in Manchester compared to the south-east of England, where I&rsquo;m originally from, where the dream of having my own 3 bed, semi-detached house would not be possible in any area with a reasonable number of IT jobs in short distance. I don&rsquo;t drive, so the fact that the tram stop is 10 minutes walk away is great for getting to work.</p>
<p>I met my current girlfriend, Conny in May, and things seem to be going very well; she is even planning to move from Berlin to Manchester to live with me. This is obviously great, and I don&rsquo;t know where I would be without her support.</p>
<p>Work</p>
<p>With all these things happening in my personal life, work took a secondary focus as I got things sorted. It also made me rethink what I wanted from my career. At the start of 2015 I had a new role, as Test Manager; the first level of technical management in my area at the BBC, and a big career move for me. Although I liked some aspects of the management role, I missed the technical challenges that had pretty much characterised the last 10 years of my career. There was not much direct coding, and I felt I was in danger of losing that aspect of my work. I took a 6 month attachment to R&amp;D, which had me working in an extremely challenging technical role, on a HTML5 360 VR engine. In April when this attachment ends, I am looking to continue in a technical role of some description, and not return to pure management, at least for the meantime.</p>
<h3 id="goals-of-2015---how-did-i-do">Goals of 2015 - How Did I Do?</h3>
<p><strong>Work Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Settle into my new role at the BBC as Test Manager</em> - As I mentioned before I&rsquo;ve taken a move towards another route in my career</li>
<li><em>Pushing for a place to be opened up in Platform Test to employ someone from the Extend Scheme</em> - This was achieved, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bmustillrose">Ben</a> has joined the BBC on an Extend placement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Creative Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Get better at music production</em> - This has been achieved. I worked with my friend Gio, who taught me quite a few tricks about Ableton. I have <a href="http://cachebuster.bandcamp.com/releases">released a 3-track EP called &lsquo;Planetary Orbital&rsquo; on Bandcamp</a>. I am also <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Synth-and-Electronic-Music-Production-Group/">helping to organise a Music Production Meetup.com in Manchester</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Getting married</em> - Nope. Maybe later.</li>
<li><em>Making friends with more people that share the same interests</em> - Partly achieved. The Meetup groups will help this. I have also helped start a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/VRManchester">&lsquo;Virtual Reality Manchester&rsquo; Meetup group, for VR fans in Manchester</a>, the first meetup is next month.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Financial Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Saving more over the course of the year</em> - Partly achieved. I have bought a house, so now I am in a quite a bit of debt, but the money I will be putting towards my mortgage will be money I am effectively &lsquo;saving&rsquo; because it will be put into the value of the house.</li>
<li><em>Joining a pension scheme</em> - Achieved.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Health Goals</strong></p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<p>ul&gt;
<em>Adopt a regular form of keeping fit</em> - Partly achieved. I have now setup a return commute which involves walking past a gym that I&rsquo;m a member of, so it is quite easy to go in there for 30 mins on the treadmill 2-3 times a week. I&rsquo;ve just got to maintain the discipline.</p>

      <title>Top 5 Recommended Upgrades for your PC</title>

      <description>I have made a lot of different upgrades and modifications to my PC, as you can see here. Some of the upgrades have made more of a difference than others though. Here is what I think you should be concentrating on, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to upgrade.
Solid State Hardisk (SSD) - Solid State hard drives use flash memory instead of the moving disk platters of traditional hard disks. It is the same type of storage as your USB stick.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have made a lot of different upgrades and modifications to my PC, <a href="http://www.davidcraddock.net/my-computer-setup/">as you can see here</a>. Some of the upgrades have made more of a difference than others though. Here is what I think you should be concentrating on, if you&rsquo;re looking to upgrade.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/upgrades.jpg" type="" alt="upgrades"  /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solid State Hardisk (SSD)</strong> - Solid State hard drives use flash memory instead of the moving disk platters of traditional hard disks. It is the same type of storage as your USB stick. This type of storage is a lot faster to access compared to magnetic storage. Upgrading will result in a huge performance increase for most systems if you are changing from a traditional hard disk. Get as big a size as you can afford. If you play computer games or do a lot of media production work, then the added space will be useful. They have reduced in price over the years, the first SSD I bought was £120 for 120GB SSD back in 2012, in 2015 I just bought a 250GB SSD for £50. So it&rsquo;s definitely affordable now.</li>
<li><strong>Large Monitor</strong> - If you can get a 27&quot;-32&quot; monitor then do so. It has made so much difference to the day to day usage of my PC. I would recommend 1440p if you can. 1440p is half the resolution of 4K. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend a 4K monitor yet in 2015 as I don&rsquo;t think they have enough software support, and the cost is considerable for a decent screen. If you&rsquo;re a gamer, then you might want to aim for a higher refresh speed, but I&rsquo;d say this should be a secondary consideration to the screen space. Look on <a href="http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/">TFTCentral</a> for reviews and guides to the different screen types available.</li>
<li><strong>Good Soundcard and Surround Sound Speaker System</strong> - Headphones are OK, but even a basic surround sound soundcard and speaker system is going to be so much better. I have a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00CRRVL4S/">Asus Xonar Phoebus Solo</a> which I recommend, it&rsquo;s a 7.1 surround sound card. I have a cheap £60 set of surround sound speakers, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003WJR482">Logitech Z506 Surround Sound Speakers</a>. Surround sound really makes a difference in gaming and movies. I think it&rsquo;s the seperate subwoofer that has the most effect, so if you are not that convinced by surround sound, you could get a 2.1 (two speakers and a subwoofer) setup for a bit less.</li>
<li><strong>Ergonomic Mouse and good mousemat</strong> - Chances are, most of the time you&rsquo;re at your PC, you will be using the mouse. It is therefore really important you have a good mouse that won&rsquo;t damange your hand after a few years use and is comfortable to use. Modern mice use laser scanners to track the position of the mouse on a flat surface. A higher resolution laser (measured in DPI - dots per inch) means that you can get more accurate tracking. Therefore look for high DPI mice for gaming or fine detail work as well as an ergonomic fit and lots of buttons. I recommend Logitech mice, after having had several Razer mice that didn&rsquo;t last very long. I would also pick up a steel mousemat, as they never get tangled up in your mouse like the fibre mousemats do.</li>
<li><strong>Recent Graphics Card</strong> - If you are into gaming or 3D modelling work, you would often prioritise this over any other upgrade. A new graphics card means that your existing games will run faster on higher detail settings, and you can play new games on higher settings with better framerate. I don&rsquo;t think it matters too much whether you go for Nvidea or AMD as long as you can run the games you want to run. If you are not interested in running the latest games, then perhaps you don&rsquo;t need this, but you may be missing out in the future.</li>

      <title>Too much Scrolling! - Tips for Dealing with Mouse-Wheel Finger Repetitive Strain Injury</title>

      <description>Recently I had noticed I&amp;rsquo;d been having quite bad problems with my fingers based on the fact that I had been scrolling the mouse wheel too much when scrolling through web pages. Here are a number of options you can take if you are in a similar situation as me:
Change OS&amp;rsquo;s scrolling speed to its maximum This is the easiest change on most modern OSs, and will result in less scroll movements made by your fingers, because each scroll movement will move the screen down by a full screen height, (equivalent to a page down).</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I had noticed I&rsquo;d been having quite bad problems with my fingers based on the fact that I had been scrolling the mouse wheel too much when scrolling through web pages. Here are a number of options you can take if you are in a similar situation as me:</p>
<h3 id="change-oss-scrolling-speed-to-its-maximum">Change OS&rsquo;s scrolling speed to its maximum</h3>
<p>This is the easiest change on most modern OSs, and will result in less scroll movements made by your fingers, because each scroll movement will move the screen down by a full screen height, (equivalent to a page down). This can be a bit annoying though as you lose accuracy when you want to just scroll down a small amount, it takes a bit of getting used to. Also you are still using the same muscles, just not as often.</p>
<h3 id="use-keyboard-shortcuts-for-scrolling">Use keyboard shortcuts for scrolling</h3>
<p>Space and shift-space should perform scrolling up and down in Firefox and Chrome on OSX and Windows. The more you avoid using the mouse and use the keyboard, the less you will use the same muscle in your fingers each time. Of course you may develop keyboard-related RSI, but so far I haven&rsquo;t been affected by this.</p>
<h3 id="change-to-an-ergonomic-mouse">Change to an Ergonomic Mouse</h3>
<p>At work I now use an ergonomic Logitch mouse which has a responsive scroll wheel, and an option to &lsquo;unlock&rsquo; the movement of the scroll wheel, allowing it to freely spin which results in greater comfort. Before I was using a work mouse which had a scroll wheel which you had to press down very hard to get it to do anything.</p>
<h3 id="use-a-touchpad">Use a Touchpad</h3>
<p>You can get freestanding touchpads for Windows and OSX, which operate like a laptop&rsquo;s touchpad. This has the advantage that you can also use trackpad gestures - Windows 8 onwards and modern versions of OSX have their own sets of handy gestures for speeding up use. I recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00969DLL6">Logitech T650 Wireless Touchpad</a> for Windows 8 onwards, and the - expensive but very impressive - <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MJ2R2Z/A/magic-trackpad-2">Apple Magic Pad 2 for OSX</a>. You can also get the Apple Magic Pad 1 which is half the price, but the feedback and gesture support isn&rsquo;t quite as good. A trackpad is not much use for gaming but for normal browsing and office use it&rsquo;s fine.</p>

      <description>As you can see, I buy a lot of bits and pieces for my PC. Occasionally though, I buy something that I feel was a disappointment, or not worth the investment. This post is meant to caution against other people making the same mistake.
Razer Tiamat - 7.1 Surround Sound Gaming Headset, with microphone (http://www.razerzone.com) This was a big dissapointment in a couple of ways. The first, and most obvious in hindsight now I&amp;rsquo;m actually working on spatial audio for a living at BBC R&amp;amp;D, is that 7.</description>

Occasionally though, I buy something that I feel was a disappointment, or not worth the investment. This post is meant to caution against other people making the same mistake.</p>
<h3 id="razer-tiamat---71-surround-sound-gaming-headset-with-microphone-httpwwwrazerzonecomhttpwwwrazerzonecom">Razer Tiamat - 7.1 Surround Sound Gaming Headset, with microphone <a href="http://www.razerzone.com">(http://www.razerzone.com)</a></h3>
<p>This was a big dissapointment in a couple of ways. The first, and most obvious in hindsight now I&rsquo;m actually working on spatial audio for a living at BBC R&amp;D, is that 7.1 surround sound headsets are a joke. There is no way you can get enough seperation between the different speaker drivers when your ears are so close to the speakers. If you have a soundcard or motherboard that supports surround sound, do yourself a favour and get a surround sound speaker set.</p>
<p>The second problem is that the Razer Tiamat has issues with electrical hum from the unshielded cables it uses. I replaced it with the <a href="http://www.roccat.org/en-GB/Products/Gaming-Sound/Kave-Series/Kave-XTD-5-1-Analog/">ROCCAT Kave XTD 5.1 Analog surround sound</a> headset which is better, although still not anything like the surround sound speaker setup which I now have.</p>

<p>I took a risk on this, it was a kickstarter idea which offered the promise of an &lsquo;intelligent&rsquo; backlight which changed colours depending on what was on the screen. And it did work pretty well.. back when I was running Windows 7. Since upgrading to Windows 10, I haven&rsquo;t been able to get it to work properly when playing games with Playclaw, which is my main use for it. I even had to purchase Playclaw, as the software which comes with Lightpack doesn&rsquo;t work well. It still has limited use for me in terms of a colour spectrum effect for music when I throw a party, through using third-party software such as Ambibox. But the company really should improve its software to work with Windows 10 gaming. It didn&rsquo;t even work well for me under Windows 8.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just recently bought a Macbook Pro for myself, after having used a MBP at work for 4 years. I find it to be a really powerful development environment for the development I do, in languages such as Java, PHP, Ruby, Python and JS. Here is what I use day-to-day:
OSX El Capitan I haven&amp;rsquo;t found anything not to like about this upgrade. I don&amp;rsquo;t use a lot of external devices, for which Bruce has found problems with El Capitan&amp;rsquo;s new restricted driver management for Arduinos and others.</description>

I find it to be a really powerful development environment for the development I do, in languages such as Java, PHP, Ruby, Python and JS. Here is what I use day-to-day:</p>
<h3 id="osx-el-capitan">OSX El Capitan</h3>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t found anything not to like about this upgrade. I don&rsquo;t use a lot of external devices, for which <a href="https://twitter.com/custardcat">Bruce</a> has found problems with El Capitan&rsquo;s new restricted driver management for Arduinos and others. I like the fact I can use split screen functionality to side-by-side two windows easily, a feature that I very much like in Windows 10 too.</p>
<h3 id="iterm-2httpswwwiterm2com"><a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm 2</a></h3>
<p>This is an awesome terminal, better than OSX&rsquo;s terminal. Nothing much more to say about it.</p>
<h3 id="fish-shellhttpfishshellcom"><a href="http://fishshell.com/">Fish Shell</a></h3>
<p>This shell has fast and smart command-line completion which is very handy and I&rsquo;d highly recommend it if you use the commandline a lot and are not totally won over by Bash. It looks nice too.</p>
<h3 id="homebrewhttpbrewsh"><a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a></h3>
<p>This is pretty much essential for command line OSX. It is a package manager which downloads and compiles the latest version of open source packages on your Mac. If you don&rsquo;t use it already, get used to it.</p>
<h3 id="intellij-webstormhttpswwwjetbrainscomwebstorm"><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">IntelliJ WebStorm</a></h3>
<p>WebStorm is great for debugging JavaScript applications, which I seem to be doing a lot of lately. I recommend the IntelliJ IDEA family of IDEs, once you get use to them, they are a great help in productive development. There are also vim and Emacs keybindings.</p>
<h3 id="vim">vim</h3>
<p>If you are a fan of vim you will know what I mean when I say I can&rsquo;t be without it. My <a href="https://github.com/wordswords/-">Dotfiles</a> show my .vimrc and plugin configuration.</p>
<h3 id="git">git</h3>
<p>Thankfully the BBC has moved over to Github, meaning all my coding uses Git. It is so useful, and not just for storing code, you can store anything.</p>
<h3 id="itunes">iTunes</h3>
<p>I use Apple Music, and iTunes Match, so iTunes is a must. It annoys me at times, but I just have to live with it.</p>
<h3 id="alfredhttpswwwalfredappcom"><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a></h3>
<p>Alfred is a replacement for Spotlight search in OSX. It has a lot of functionality that I&rsquo;m still getting my head around, but it speeds up my OSX workflow a lot when undertaking frequent tasks such as Google searching.</p>
<h3 id="evernotehttpevernotecom"><a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a></h3>
<p>Evernote is so useful for making and sharing notes on my phone, mac, work computer.. anywhere</p>
<h3 id="droplrhttpdroplrcom"><a href="http://droplr.com">Droplr</a></h3>
<p>This is something someone only recently recommended to me. It seems very useful from what I&rsquo;ve seen, great way to share images files, screenshots, webcasts.. anything. Also it has as expiry policy for media, like Snapchat, so it doesn&rsquo;t exist on the internet for generations to come.</p>

      <title>Next Big Thing: Voice Control for Home Automation</title>

      <description>So, I have totally bought in to the home automation craze that is currently &amp;rsquo;the next big thing&amp;rsquo; in the technology world in 2015. Apple has released iOS 9 with their HomeKit home automation framework, Google have the Nest series of smart devices, and there are numerous emerging competitors and hundreds of devices out there right now that will network together in your home.
For the uninitiated, a &amp;lsquo;virtual assistant&amp;rsquo; is a cloud-connected voice processing system which you can &amp;rsquo;talk&amp;rsquo; to.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I have totally bought in to the home automation craze that is currently &rsquo;the next big thing&rsquo; in the technology world in 2015. Apple has released iOS 9 with their HomeKit home automation framework, Google have the Nest series of smart devices, and there are numerous emerging competitors and hundreds of devices out there right now that will network together in your home.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, a &lsquo;virtual assistant&rsquo; is a cloud-connected voice processing system which you can &rsquo;talk&rsquo; to. This is how a voice assistant essentially works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. You speak into the device. Your device will record what you&rsquo;ve said, and send it to the cloud.
2. In the cloud, sophisticated and adaptive voice recognition software analyses what you&rsquo;ve said and converts it into text.
3. The text command is run on a server somewhere, for example the command, &lsquo;what is the weather today?&rsquo; will fetch the latest weather report for your area and summarise it.
4. The summarised report is converted into speech and streamed back to your device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple have Siri, Microsoft have Cortana, Google has Google Now and Amazon have Alexa. These are all voice assistants which utilise the power of big data and machine learning over millions of requests to improve their own accurately.</p>
<p>The more people use virtual assistants, the better they get. Apple have been really pushing Siri, including it in the Apple Watch and most recently the new Apple TV. Not necessarily because it&rsquo;s what people want *now*, but because they are banking on enough people using it so it snowballs into the lead, vastly improves in functionality, and becomes ubiquitous in the home, maybe 5-10 years down the line.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s Siri has reported a 40% reduction in errors recently, meaning only 5% of the words it processes, on average, are misread. This clearly can, and will, improve as more people use it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The speech recognition capability in Siri now has a 5 percent word error rate, thanks to a 40 percent reduction on the part of Apple, Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, said today at Apple’s 2015 Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazon, meanwhile, has the &lsquo;Alexa&rsquo; virtual assistant, which seems to have most use in home automation. Although Siri is linked in with Apple&rsquo;s &lsquo;HomeKit&rsquo; automation standard, HomeKit-enabled devices are only just now starting to be released, and reliability is currently a problem. Meanwhile, Google have concentrated on providing a small number of reliable devices in their Wi-Fi enabled &lsquo;Nest&rsquo; series. Google&rsquo;s Nest Thermostat has recently integrated Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa virtual assistant to recognise speech commands such as &rsquo;turn up the temperature to 20 degrees&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What a lot of people are saying is the &lsquo;killer app&rsquo; for virtual assistants is the handsfree speaker and microphone unit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo/dp/B00X4WHP5E">&lsquo;Amazon Echo&rsquo;</a>. Amazon Echo is a small unit with a highly sensitive microphone and speaker, which sits in your living room and you can &rsquo;talk&rsquo; to it, just like you would with Google Now or Apple&rsquo;s Siri. The best thing about Amazon Echo is that it can talk to other smart home devices, such as the popular Phillips Hue lights, the Nest thermostat, various security cameras. <a href="http://www.davidcraddock.net/2015/10/15/ifttt-com-program-your-life/">It also integrates with the site IFTTT.com</a> which is like a giant patchbay for smart devices, allowing you to connect them together and cause a state in one device to trigger an action.</p>
<p>So you can be sitting in your living room, and say &lsquo;Dim all the lights in the house&rsquo; and Amazon Echo will do just that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, due to the fact that it uses Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing search and doesn&rsquo;t give you an option to choose a different search engine, it is not legal to sell the Amazon Echo in the UK due to a non-competition covering search engines in EU law. Therefore there is still an open gap in the market for this type of product, one which Apple&rsquo;s HomeKit and Siri integration is racing to fill. However the closed nature of the HomeKit world means that it is likely that it won&rsquo;t integrate with the non-Apple setup of Google Nest and others.</p>

      <title>Introversion, Extroversion and the BBC Software Engineer</title>

      <description>Whether you agree with Myers-Briggs personality profiling or not, like fellow BBC&amp;rsquo;er Ian Forrester I have found them a useful frame of reference from which to discuss my personality, because I see similarities between my perception of me, and the classification.
I took the Myers-Briggs personality profiling, and it has labelled me on several occasions an INTP:
INTPs are marked by a quiet, stoic, modest, and aloof exterior that masks strong creativity and enthusiasm for novel possibilities.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/introvert.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/introvert.jpg" type="" alt="introvert"  /></a></p>
<p>Whether you agree with Myers-Briggs personality profiling or not, like fellow BBC&rsquo;er <a href="http://cubicgarden.com/2015/07/27/being-entp-dyslexic-and-relationships/">Ian Forrester</a> I have found them a useful frame of reference from which to discuss my personality, because I see similarities between my perception of me, and the classification.</p>
<p>I took the Myers-Briggs personality profiling, and it has labelled me on several occasions an INTP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>INTPs are marked by a quiet, stoic, modest, and aloof exterior that masks strong creativity and enthusiasm for novel possibilities. Their weaknesses include poor organization, insensitivity to social niceties, and a tendency to get lost in abstractions. Keirsey referred to INTPs as Architects, one of the four types belonging to the temperament he called the Rationals
&hellip;
I – Introversion preferred to extraversion: INTPs tend to be quiet and reserved. They generally prefer interacting with a few close friends rather than a wide circle of acquaintances, and they expend energy in social situations (whereas extraverts gain energy).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this bad news for me? Introversion can be seen as a negative in today&rsquo;s hyper-communicative world, especially for a team-based work environment. However I don&rsquo;t think it need be a problem in an organisation that prioritises abstract thinking and creativity, because introverts are often very strong in both. The technology and R&amp;D side of the BBC, I would argue, is such an organisation.</p>
<p>I know a few people from Imperial College London, one of the top universities in the world for Computer Science (and Science Technology Engineering and Medicine in general) and have found it full of technically gifted introverts. Now, I didn&rsquo;t go to Imperial myself, but it does seem that there is a correlation between introversion and high amounts of technical ability. I have found this also with a lot of software engineers that I have worked with.</p>
<p>I am not saying necessarily that all good software engineers are extreme introverts, in fact I would say that this is untrue in a number of cases. This is because Agile software engineering often uses techniques such as pair programming from Extreme Programming, and it helps to have extroversion when dealing with hyper-social practices such as programming as a pair every day all day (which I have done, and found it very draining).</p>
<p>In fact, I have noticed that technical ability is less important than your ability to work in a team at the BBC. I generally have fairly good social skills and tend to like introverts so I personally have not had a problem with dealing with people who were very introverted but were technically quite brilliant. However it was clear that these types of people just didn&rsquo;t seem to fit in quite as well in BBC teams with high collaboration aspects. I think this may be down to cultural fit rather than something we can extrapolate over all software engineering organisations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/512etxcgw6l-_sx379_bo1204203200_.jpg" type="" alt="512eTxcGW6L.&lt;em&gt;SX379_BO1,204,203,200&lt;/em&gt;"  /></a></p>
<p>Indeed, aside from my anecdotal evidence, in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321">&lsquo;Making Software&rsquo;</a> Jo E. Hannay analyses the academic research on what type of personality programmers have, and what effect this has on their work. She writes;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that programmers deviated from a reference group in that they are lower on Extraversion, lower on Emotional Stability, and higher on Openness to Experience [Hannay et al. 2010]. See also [Moore 1991], [Smith 1989], [Woodruff 1979], [Capretz 2003], and [Turley and Bieman 1995] for related results. Programmers are also more homogeneous than the population as a whole; that is, programmers vary less in personality than do people in general.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So programmers tend to be introverts. Not really hugely suprising is it? However, she also notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We investigated .. in the context of 198 professional programmers pair programming over one day [Hannay et al. 2010]. We found that personality was a weak predictor of pair programming performance. Even crude measures of expertise, task complexity, and even the country in which the programmers where employed had greater predictive power than personality. The study also included an analysis of personality on individual programming and whether the effect on performance of pairing up had anything to do with personality. Again, expertise and task complexity are stronger predictors than personality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore an introverted personality is a poor predictor of pair programming performance across the industry. She goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In ethnographic studies focusing on personality issues and disruption in software engineering team collaboration, it was found that disruption is bad, but lack of debate (which is a mild form of disruption) is worse [Karn and Cowling 2006], [Karn and Cowling 2005]. It is argued that pairs or teams with personalities that are too alike will lead to lack of debate. This finds empirical confirmation in [Williams et al. 2006] and [Walle and Hannay 2009]. In particular, differences in Extraversion has the largest effect: pairs whose peers have different levels of Extraversion collaborate more intensely (that is, engage in more discussion) than those with more similar levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She is saying that a pair of extroverted and introverted personalities collaborate more strongly than a homogenous pair. To me, this is good evidence that introversion and extroversion have their place in modern software development teams across the industry, and both types of personality should be culturally valued for collaboration, not just extroverts, even at hyper-collaborative organisations such as the BBC.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finished my 6U Eurorack case. It took me 9 months to build, buying a couple of modules a month.
Goals I wanted to make a self-contained dual voice synthesizer that would interface with my 2x Doepfer Dark Energy MK1s and my Microbrute, on a budget. I also wanted to add some random sound generation features.
I chose to make the synthesizer out of Doepfer modules because they are easy to find cheap second-hand, and also because they are well-engineered.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve finished my 6U Eurorack case. It took me 9 months to build, buying a couple of modules a month.</p>
<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>I wanted to make a self-contained dual voice synthesizer that would interface with my 2x Doepfer Dark Energy MK1s and my Microbrute, on a budget. I also wanted to add some random sound generation features.</p>
<p>I chose to make the synthesizer out of Doepfer modules because they are easy to find cheap second-hand, and also because they are well-engineered. (If they&rsquo;re good enough for Kraftwerk, who am I to complain?)</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/eurorack.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/eurorack.png" type="" alt="eurorack"  /></a></p>
<h4 id="oscillators-and-sound-generation">Oscillators and Sound Generation</h4>
<ol>
<li>2x standard Doepfer <em>A-110-1 VCOs</em> with pulse-width modulation. I am no expert, but find these oscillators sound good enough for the money.</li>
<li><em>A-118 Random Noise</em> module, which outputs white and coloured noise. This has been useful for adding noise to a patch, as well as feeding the random noise generator through the quantizer and S&amp;H modules for interesting random effects.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="lfos-and-envelopes">LFOs and Envelopes</h4>
<ol>
<li><em>A-143-3 Quad LFO</em>, which has been very useful in modulating my external gear, such as my Microbrute and Doepfer Dark Energy synths. I find it&rsquo;s a good utility module to just patch something up for modulation, even though I rarely find myself using all 4 LFOs at once.</li>
<li><em>A-145 LFO</em> - I actually find myself wishing this was a VCLFO so that I could make midi-synced LFO sweeps, and might replace it with one eventually. I like the reset feature though.</li>
<li>2x <em>A-140 ADSR</em> - Standard envelopes, I bought two so I can modulate the VCA and filter separately at the same time, as is standard in synthesizers.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="mixers-and-vcas">Mixers and VCAs</h4>
<ol>
<li><em>A-132-3 Dual VCA</em> - Another standard module, this is particularly useful as it has two VCAs, so I can feed each oscillator into its own separate VCA. I would like another one of these so I could amplify the output of the noise module separately from the VCOs.</li>
<li>2x <em>A-138 Exponential Mixers</em> - I have two so I can mix multiple waveforms from the VCOs with the white noise output from my noise generator module. The mixer in the bottom right corner of the case has rubber no-slip knobs, and I use it for the main output from my synth.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="quantizer-and-sh">Quantizer and S&amp;H</h4>
<ol>
<li><em>A-156 Dual Quantizer</em> - This is a really fun module which I use with LFOs, envelopes and my noise generator to make musical sounds from non-musical sources. I think it will come into its own when I get the Make Noise Maths module, which is on my &rsquo;next steps&rsquo; list.</li>
<li><em>A-148 Dual Sample &amp; Hold</em> - This is a module I haven&rsquo;t quite grasped the utility of yet, I currently use it wired up to filters and a LFO for S&amp;H filter effects.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="filters">Filters</h4>
<p>I love filters.. so I got quite a few!</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A-120 VCF1 Low Pass Filter</em> (Moog style) - The standard moogy filter, nothing wrong with it. I like the sound but mostly use it for filter sweeps.</li>
<li><em>A-127 Triple Voltage Controlled Resonance Filter with Breakout Box</em> - This is the key element of my setup. It allows for some really nice multiple filter chaining effects. I have the top filter set to &lsquo;Low Pass&rsquo; mode, and the second and third filters set to &lsquo;Band pass&rsquo; mode. Since I already have a LP filter in the Moog style A-120 I may change this back so it becomes a triple BP filter, which is the default. You can make some really nice patches with the inbuilt LFOs modulating the filter sweeps, but usually I will wire it up to my Quad LFO for modulation. As a unit, it is really good at making vowel-like sounds for eerie &lsquo;almost human voice&rsquo; effects. The breakout box, which I haven&rsquo;t soldered in yet, so haven&rsquo;t actually used, will expand the possibilities of the unit even more, allowing me to put separate filers on each oscillator, for example. Love this module.</li>
<li><em>A-106-1 Xtreme Filter</em> - I haven&rsquo;t used this much yet, but I just had to have the MS-20 style LP/HP filter in my case, and this filter ticks all the boxes.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="midi-interface-and-multiples">MIDI Interface and Multiples</h4>
<ol>
<li><em>Kenton Pro Solo MIDI-to-CV interface</em> - I use this with my computer, allowing me to send CV for the oscillators through the Intelligel Buff Mult. It has clock out and a bunch of different features, such as portamento and even a LFO.</li>
<li><em>Intelligel &lsquo;Buff Mult&rsquo;</em> - My only non-Doepfer module. This is a buffered multiplier, meant to make sure that fast pitch changes are duplicated correctly over the oscillators. I also wire up my Doepfer Dark Energy Mk1s to this, so I can have 4 oscillators playing at once.</li>
<li><em>A180-1 Multipler</em> - Just a standard multiplier which I use because I don&rsquo;t use stackable cables (can&rsquo;t afford them).</li>

      <description>Some things I have been meaning to investigate in my own time, but haven&amp;rsquo;t, because life just gets in the way.
Maths - It might surprise a few people that, as a software developer, I never took maths to A-level. I picked up a bit of maths in my CS degree, but I never really got a firm grounding in it. This has prevented me from understanding and coding advanced stuff in game development, understanding audio to a decent level, and generally doing things in which I consider the more interesting fields of computing.</description>

<li>Maths
- It might surprise a few people that, as a software developer, I never took maths to A-level. I picked up a bit of maths in my CS degree, but I never really got a firm grounding in it. This has prevented me from understanding and coding advanced stuff in game development, understanding audio to a decent level, and generally doing things in which I consider the more interesting fields of computing.</li>
<li>Music Theory
- I have been getting better at playing the piano/keyboard by ear, but I have never fully learned to read music, and I would like to.</li>
<li>Electronics
- I would love to be able to build simple DIY synthesiser module kits for my Eurorack setup. I imagine I&rsquo;d have to start on something small though.</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be great if I could take courses in these subjects, via the OU or something similar. I just have to find the time.</p>

      <title>Goals for the Year 2015 - Midway Update</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2015/09/01/goals-for-the-year-2015-midway-update/</link>

      <guid>http://davidcraddock.net/2015/09/01/goals-for-the-year-2015-midway-update/</guid>
      <description>Now that I am midway through the year, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d revisit the goals I set myself at the start of the year, to see what has changed.
Career Goals Settle into my new role at the BBC as Test Manager - I suppose this has not been achieved. I will have more updates soon (hopefully) but a change of direction is likely to happen. Pushing for a place to be opened up in Platform Test to employ someone from the Extend Scheme - This has been achieved, and someone will be joining Platform Test from the Extend scheme in October, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say.</description>

<p>Now that I am midway through the year, I thought I&rsquo;d revisit <a href="http://www.davidcraddock.net/?p=1301&amp;preview=true">the goals I set myself at the start of the year</a>, to see what has changed.</p>
<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Settle into my new role at the BBC as Test Manager</em> - I suppose this has not been achieved. I will have more updates soon (hopefully) but a change of direction is likely to happen.</li>
<li><em>Pushing for a place to be opened up in Platform Test to employ someone from the Extend Scheme</em> - This has been achieved, and someone will be joining Platform Test from the Extend scheme in October, I&rsquo;m happy to say.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creative-goals">Creative Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Get better at music production</em> - This has been achieved. I have been working with my friend I will call &lsquo;G&rsquo;, which has massively improved my production skills. I have posted music that I see as much better to Soundcloud.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="social-goals">Social Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Getting married</em> - Well.. things didn&rsquo;t work out with that. But I have a new girlfriend who will hopefully be moving to live with me, so things seem to be recovering there.</li>
<li><em>Making friends with more people that share the same interests</em> - Partly achieved. G is a good example of someone that I have met through looking for friends with the same interest.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="financial-goals">Financial Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Saving more over the course of the year</em> - Partly achieved. I have bought a house, so now I am in a quite a bit of debt, but the money I will be putting towards my mortgage will be money I am effectively &lsquo;saving&rsquo; because it will be put into the value of the house.</li>
<li><em>Joining a pension scheme</em> - Achieved.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="health-goals">Health Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Adopt a regular form of keeping fit</em> - Not achieved. I have a gym even closer to where I live, 5 minutes walk, so hopefully I will use it more soon. It is difficult for me, as the medication I&rsquo;m on makes me feel tired all the time, but they do say that exercise improves energy levels.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ve achieved the majority of my goals, I haven&rsquo;t achieved two of the major goals - around my job and around exercise, which are both things I need to work on. There is still time left this year to make a difference in these areas.</p>

      <title>Use Siri, Apple Earphones and Apple Music Together</title>

      <description>This requires you to have a subscription to Apple Music and a 3G/4G/wireless data connection, but it is so useful! Using this tip, you can be walking along with your iPhone in your pocket and your Apple earphones in, and then change music just by pressing a button on the earphones remote control and saying &amp;lsquo;Play (your favourite band)&amp;rsquo;.
1. Activate Siri and subscribe to Apple Music. I used to subscribe to Spotify so I switched to Apple Music when I realised the advantages of the integration on my phone, and the wider selection of music.</description>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/blog-post-image.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/blog-post-image.png" type="" alt="blog post image"  /></a></p>
<p>1. Activate Siri and subscribe to Apple Music. I used to subscribe to Spotify so I switched to Apple Music when I realised the advantages of the integration on my phone, and the wider selection of music. You will also need to set Siri to stream music over your cellular network, this can be done in the &lsquo;Music&rsquo; section of iOS settings.</p>
<p>2. Put the iPhone in your pocket with the standard Apple Earphones plugged in. With the standard Apple Earphones, there is a remote control on the cable with one button on it. To activate Siri, hold that button down for a couple of seconds until you hear the &lsquo;Siri&rsquo; &lsquo;bleep&rsquo;.</p>
<p>3. Say &lsquo;Play The Prodigy&rsquo; if you want to listen to The Prodigy, for example. This may require a couple of tries occasionally, but usually it just works.</p>
<p>4. Siri should look up The Prodigy on Apple Music, find their most popular songs, put them in a playlist, start streaming them and playing them through your earphones. To skip a song, press the remote control button twice in quick succession. To adjust the volume, press the edges of your remote control, the top edge to increase volume, the bottom edge to decrease. To pause all music playback, just press the remote control button once. To resume playback, press the remote control button once again.</p>
<p>A limitation of this is that you have to be in an area with good reception, enough to stream your tracks from Apple Music. You shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem if you live in a city like Manchester, I usually get 4G across the whole city.</p>

      <description>My Eurorack modular has been progressing. I&amp;rsquo;ve added several low-cost modules, a Doepfer A-138b audio mixer module so I can mix the audio outputs of the oscilators, the noise output, and my Doepfer Dark Energy modules. I found this so useful with the Dark Energys that I have ordered another mixer. This I can use to mix audio before sending it to the filter, for example, or mix audio before sending it to a VCA to be amplified.</description>

This I can use to mix audio before sending it to the filter, for example, or mix audio before sending it to a VCA to be amplified. I also added another envelope generator, Doepfer A-140, a sturdy workhorse and also useful for triggering the filter independently of the VCA envelope. Then I added a syncable LFO.. I already have 4 LFOs from the quad-LFO module in the top right, but I wanted a LFO with a reset option that I can use for MIDI syncing. On order is also a A-148 S&amp;H (sample and hold) module which I will use for generating interesting random tones once I have expanded the &lsquo;generative music&rsquo; theme of my setup a bit more.</p>
<p>I also added a secondhand Kenton Pro Solo, a small midi-to-cv converter which has a lot of features, including clock sync output as well as CV and gate.</p>
<p>Next purchases may include (all Doepfer) a ring-mod, small essential module that it is. I also want a clock divider and clock sequencer, allowing me to take the midi clock output of my Kenton Pro Solo and link it up to activate timed triggers. I eventually want to get a Make Noise &lsquo;Maths&rsquo; module as the highlight of my small modular, but the budget does not permit that right now.</p>

      <description>If you have two soundcards - maybe a normal soundcard for your speakers and maybe a headset with its own audio interface - you will want some way of switching all audio between the two. This is an great little open-source tool to do just that. It works on Mac, and Windows 7 up to 10:

      <description>Two Ruby gems that I contributed to from my days in the BBC&amp;rsquo;s TITAN (Test Tools and Infrastructure) team, have been open-sourced. So finally I can say that I have made proper open-source contributions. The gems are for making automating of Android phones via Android Calabash easier, and are used in a lot of the mobile testing we do at the BBC. Here they are:

      <description>I have a lot of different instruments, both hardware and software, for making music, but here is what I use the most at the moment:
Piano I have an actual electric piano but I don&amp;rsquo;t use the onboard sound engine, preferring to use it as a midi controller for a software piano sound. Recently I bought Ableton Live Full Suite, before I was using the &amp;lsquo;Grand Piano&amp;rsquo; sound from the default install.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a lot of different instruments, both hardware and software, for making music, but here is what I use the most at the moment:</p>
<p><strong>Piano</strong>
I have an actual electric piano but I don&rsquo;t use the onboard sound engine, preferring to use it as a midi controller for a software piano sound. Recently I bought Ableton Live Full Suite, before I was using the &lsquo;Grand Piano&rsquo; sound from the default install. Now there is a whole &lsquo;Piano&rsquo; Ableton Live pack, and that seems to offer much more realistic piano sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Drums</strong>
Lately I&rsquo;ve been using the <a href="https://soniccharge.com/microtonic">Sonic Charge&rsquo;s Microtonic</a> for drums, because I have been making more dance-orientated music. I find the drums really good, and they&rsquo;re already fully processed with effects so you can just slot them into the mix. I also have been using the built-in Ableton 909 kit sound a lot, but might move away from that as I don&rsquo;t like the sound compared to Microtonic. At some point in the future I will probably get my Nord Drum hardware drum synth out, but for now I can&rsquo;t find the power supply so it&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p><strong>Synth</strong>
I have been using my modular and semi-modular synthesizer as a main bassline synth, with some sounds from Ableton over the top. I have used the Access Virus synth quite a bit for synth duty, and it has some great presets for evolving arps.</p>

<p>I have finished filling the top half of my Eurorack case, see above. Here is a list of modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a1323.htm">Dual VCA - A-132-3</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.intellijel.com/eurorack-modules/buff-mult/">Buffered Multiples - Intellij Buff Mult</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a1433.htm">Quad LFO - A-143-3 Quad LFO</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Next Moves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a logarithmic mixer module <a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a138.htm">A-138b</a> for mixing the output of the noise + two VCOs into the filter, and to free up some of my ZED-10 mixer channels for other things</li>
<li>Got another <a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a140.htm">A-140</a> ADSR module but no cable, going to get a cable and put it into the bottom left corner of the lower section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<p>My (mostly) Doepfer Eurorack is hooked up to my Microbrute, 2x Doepfer Dark Energy MK1s and my ZED-10 recording mixer.</p>
<p>The Microbrute acts as a pitch and gate out keyboard controller for all the synths and a semi-modular synthesiser in its own right with its patchbay.</p>
<p>The Doepfer Dark Energys are complete synth voices with a fair amount of input/outputs for modulation. They are hooked up to the pitch and gate out from the Microbrute via the Buff Mult and the Multiples on the Eurorack.</p>
<p>One configuration that I often use when composing music, is wire the Eurorack, the Dark Energys and the Microbrute into the ZED-10 mixer, tune each so they all play together, and create one massive analogue 5-osc synth mono voice which is great for devastating basslines, and I can modulate with the LFOs and envelopes in the system. I can then program a sequence into the Microbrute and transpose it when I play notes down on the Microbrute keyboard, or control it via the USB IN from Ableton.</p>
<p>Another configuration which I find interesting is patching the output of the Noise Generator/Random through the Quantizer. This results in random musical notes played by the oscilator, and you can create interesting pattern or arpeggios created solely by the Euroack without human input. I like the idea of generative music, and will be buying more modules to create more interesting computer generated randomness and music.</p>

      <description>I am putting together a small modular synthesiser setup. Modular synthesizers are synthesizers composed of small individual modules, which are wired up to create a circuit for producing sound. They were very popular in the 1970s, with big bands such as Emmerson, Lake and Palmer, Kraftwerk and Jean Michael Jarre all owning big modular setups:
Modular synthesisers have had a resurgence in recent years with modern versions becoming available. One producer of modular synthesiser modules is Doepfer, a German company who&amp;rsquo;s modular synthesizer standard &amp;lsquo;Eurorack&amp;rsquo; has become very popular recently.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am putting together a small modular synthesiser setup. Modular synthesizers are synthesizers composed of small individual modules, which are wired up to create a circuit for producing sound. They were very popular in the 1970s, with big bands such as Emmerson, Lake and Palmer, Kraftwerk and Jean Michael Jarre all owning big modular setups:</p>
<p>Modular synthesisers have had a resurgence in recent years with modern versions becoming available. One producer of modular synthesiser modules is <a href="http://www.doepfer.de">Doepfer</a>, a German company who&rsquo;s modular synthesizer standard &lsquo;Eurorack&rsquo; has become very popular recently. I have decided to build a small Eurorack modular, here it is so far:</p>
<p>The blank plates are spaces for modules that I haven&rsquo;t bought yet, I am slowly accumulating them. I have currently been wiring my modular setup to my &lsquo;semi-modular&rsquo; synths. They include the Microbrute, and 2x Dark Energy MK1s synths, shown below:</p>
<p>A semi-modular synth is a similar to a standard synthesizer, where all the synthesizer functions are self-contained in one case e.g. they are not just lots of modules. A semi-modular synth will work in its own right, without any additional wiring required. However, a semi-modular synth also has inputs which allow you to optionally wire up the semi-modular synth to other modules and semi-modular synths. So, it allows you to make one big sound processing circuit with all your synths wired together. Which is what I&rsquo;ve been doing:</p>
<p>So, not quite Keith Emerson, but it&rsquo;s a start! But why would you do this, I hear you ask. What possible reason would you have for wiring up synthesisers in this manner? Well:</p>
<ul>
<li>It expands the creative potential of your synthesizers. Instead of just having a few ways of creating sounds, you now have a lot more. Modular synthesisers have been used heavily in EA Games &lsquo;The Sims 3&rsquo; for sound effects. Oscar-winning &lsquo;The Social Network&rsquo; soundtrack by Trent Reznor uses modular synthesizers heavily, and more.</li>
<li>It allows you to build a synthesizer exactly the way you want to, with all the features you wanted for the type of music you make.</li>
<li>You end up learning a LOT about synthesis and how synthesizers are made, which can feed in to better sound design in the future, not to mention if you have an interest in electronics and music technology, this is a great way to learn.</li>
<li>If you are inspired musically by the technical side of music technology, (and a lot of producers such as <a href="http://www.deadmau5.com/">Deadmau5</a> are) then it gives you another creative workflow to experiment with.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s fun. Wiring up things experimentally and creating sounds you never could have predicted would happen. The combinations are so exponential that you usually have no idea what will happen, and it&rsquo;s almost like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiUAq4aVTjY">machine created sounds just for you</a>.</li>

      <description>NOTE: I have an update on my progress as of 9/1/2015 here
Motivated by my good friend CheerUpLove.com&amp;rsquo;s reflective style of blogging, and Ian Forrester&amp;rsquo;s many interesting posts, I thought it would be interesting to post something a bit more personal and less technical on this blog.
Now that 2015 is upon us, I am going to take some time to publicly outline my goals for the year, so I can hold myself more accountable to them, and so I can look back on them this time next year.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NOTE: <a href="http://www.davidcraddock.net/2015/09/01/goals-for-the-year-2015-midway-update/">I have an update on my progress as of 9/1/2015 here</a></p>
<p>Motivated by my good friend <a href="http://cheeruplove.com/">CheerUpLove.com</a>&rsquo;s reflective style of blogging, and <a href="http://cubicgarden.com">Ian Forrester</a>&rsquo;s many interesting posts, I thought it would be interesting to post something a bit more personal and less technical on this blog.</p>
<p>Now that 2015 is upon us, I am going to take some time to publicly outline my goals for the year, so I can hold myself more accountable to them, and so I can look back on them this time next year.</p>
<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>
<p>One of my most important goals at the moment is to settle into my new role at the BBC as Test Manager. It is a step up for me, and I want to prove my stripes. I also will be pushing for a place to be opened up with Platform Test to employ someone from the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/careers/trainee-schemes-and-apprenticeships/extend/extend" title="Extend Scheme">Extend Scheme</a>.
<strong>What Success Will Look Like :</strong> Growing my team, Extendee placement, good performance reviews.</p>
<h3 id="creative-goals">Creative Goals</h3>
<p>I have been improving my music production skills a great deal over the past year, a pastime that I find very rewarding. I have also started piano lessons, which I aim to continue with. I aim to continue getting better, and maybe to look into another evening music course - perhaps the Game Audio course at Futureworks Manchester.
<strong>What Success Will Look Like :</strong> Improved music posted to Soundcloud, collaborations with other musicians, better ability at piano</p>
<h3 id="social-goals">Social Goals</h3>
<p>Getting married is going to be the main point of the year for me, with the wedding coming in September. Lots of preparing to do. I also want to keep the good friendships that I have at the moment, but perhaps make some new friends, particularly those who are into the same interests as me
<strong>What Success Will Look Like :</strong> Becoming Mr. Lewin, making friends with more people that are interested in the same things as I am</p>
<h3 id="financial-goals">Financial Goals</h3>
<p>I need to be saving more over the course of the year. I also want to join the BBC pension scheme, as I don&rsquo;t really have a pension yet
<strong>What Success Will Look Like :</strong> Significant savings at the end of the year, joining the pension scheme</p>
<h3 id="health-goals">Health Goals</h3>
<p>My fitness is something I need to become more serious about. I enjoy long-distance indoor rowing for stamina and fitness. I would like to do more of this, and there is a gym just down my road, so there isn&rsquo;t much excuse for me not to.
<strong>What Success Will Look Like :</strong> Adopt a regular form of keeping fit</p>
<p>So.. I will look back on this post through the year and hopefully it will motivate me to achieve these goals. Currently I think these goals are achievable, and I think 2015 will be a great year.</p>

      <title>microKORG Original &#43; Novation Impulse 61</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2014/10/31/microkorg-original-novation-impulse-61/</link>

      <description>I picked up a rather ugly (but very cheap!) customised microKORG, and also the excellent Novation Impulse 61 USB/Midi keyboard controller.
The microKORG I like a lot. It was my first synth, and at first I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense of it. I do agree with the Reddit /r/synthesizers view that it is not the best synth to learn on. Their view is that the best synth to learn on is one with a one-to-one mapping between controls and sound engine parameters.</description>

<p>The <a href="http://www.vintagesynth.com/korg/microkorg.php" title="microKORG">microKORG</a> I like a lot. It was my first synth, and at first I couldn&rsquo;t make any sense of it. I do agree with the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/">Reddit /r/synthesizers</a> view that it is not the best synth to learn on. Their view is that the best synth to learn on is one with a one-to-one mapping between controls and sound engine parameters. To put another way, the best beginners synth is one which has lots of knobs and buttons on it that you can tweak and hear actual results in the sound. It makes it more difficult if the sound engine is hidden away behind a large menu system with lots of daunting menus, like the microKORG has.</p>
<p>However, now I know the basics of synthesis, I&rsquo;m finding it much easier to get the most out of the microKORG. You can also map a midi controller to a lot of the parameters, turning it into a poor man&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.vintagesynth.com/korg/ms2000.php" title="MS2000">MS2000</a>. The older MS2000 shares the same engine as the MK.</p>
<p>The Novation Impulse 61 is great, although it does take up a lot of desk space. The keybed is much better than any controller I&rsquo;ve tried before, and even though it&rsquo;s not weighted like my digital piano, it is very playable. The aftertouch and the velocity sensitivity are settings I will no doubt appreciate more in the future, for now I just turn them off. The arpegiator with the step sequencer is amazing! It turns the arpegiator into a little groovebox. It is quite similar to the arp sequencer on the microKORG, where you can hit the pads to change the notes on the fly. However the Impulse pads are a lot more sturdy, and responsive.</p>
<p>There is a lot about the Novation Automap functionality that I haven&rsquo;t explored. I want to wire up my old <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov06/articles/remotezero.htm" title="Novation Remote SL">Remote Zero SL</a> unit as a controller for the microKORG, so I have more of a one-to-one mapping between knobs and the MS2000 parameter functionality exposed via MIDI on the microKORG.</p>

      <title>Pioneer DDJ-SR Serato Controller Review</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2014/09/03/pioneer-ddj-sr-serato-controller-review/</link>

      <guid>http://davidcraddock.net/2014/09/03/pioneer-ddj-sr-serato-controller-review/</guid>
      <description>I decided to buy the DDJ-SR controller because it was cheaper than even the cheapest pair of Pioneer CDJs. I’m no stranger to using a laptop and controller, before the DDJ-SR I used my trusty Faderfox DJ2 controller, which is a basic no-frills ‘play buttons, 3 EQs, crossfader and volume faders’ unit.
I was considering getting the Native Instruments Traktor S4 DJ controller, which is one of the most popular full-size controllers for Traktor.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dj-controller.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dj-controller.jpg" type="" alt="dj controller"  /></a></p>
<p>I decided to buy the DDJ-SR controller because it was cheaper than even the cheapest pair of Pioneer CDJs. I’m no stranger to using a laptop and controller, before the DDJ-SR I used my trusty Faderfox DJ2 controller, which is a basic no-frills ‘play buttons, 3 EQs, crossfader and volume faders’ unit.</p>
<p>I was considering getting the Native Instruments Traktor S4 DJ controller, which is one of the most popular full-size controllers for Traktor. However, after borrowing one from a friend, I compared the build quality of the DDJ-SR versus the S4, and there was no contest! The Pioneer DDJ-SR has the same buttons and jog wheel as the Pioneer CDJ units, which are rock solid and industry standard. For anyone wanting to use CDJs in the club after using the DDJ-SR at home, you will find the feel very familiar.</p>
<p>I looked at the DDJ-SR’s big brother, the DDJ-SX1. The SX is much bigger in size, and not as portable as the SR. This was a major factor for me, as it’s often difficult enough to find space in the DJ booth, even for a small controller. The DDJ-SX1 (not the newest model which may be out by now) has a pretty similar feature set to the DDJ-SR. There is only one main difference that is significant to me. That being the fact that the SX is a full 4-channel mixer, which can operate without being connected to a computer. But it wasn’t enough to justify the larger footprint and the much increased cost. So I decided to opt for the more portable DDJ-SR.</p>
<p>I tried out the controller at my local music shop, <a href="http://www.dawsons.co.uk/stores/music-shop-manchester">Dawsons (Manchester)</a> . I recommend trying out the controller and also buying locally if you can, because it’s much easier to return a controller to the shop than it is to send it back to an online store, if you are not happy with it. I also believe in supporting your local music stores.</p>
<p>Being used to Traktor, and having used it since 2006, I was initially a bit cautious over switching to Serato. After I played around with it, and for my typical use, there was not a lot in Traktor that I didn’t find equivalents for, in Serato. One thing that was very nice is seeing the waveforms from each deck, and how you can visually ‘sync up’ the starting track with the beats of the one that is already playing. I have been surprised about how useful this is, it really makes beatmatching so easy when you don’t want to use the sync button, which I often don’t.</p>
<p>The DDJ-SR comes with 8 pads under each jog wheel. They are very responsive, every bit as responsive as Akai drum pads used for music production. The pad FX definitely expand the creative potential of laptop DJing. The ‘slicer’ is my favourite so far, it cuts the upcoming music into 8 slices. You can choose to play a slice (or beat) out of time with the progression of the track, for example, instead of 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 you can opt for 1-2-2-4-5-6-6-8. You can play combination you like, assuming you hit the right pads in time!</p>
<p>The ‘slip’ feature is very nice. When toggled on, the track plays on as you trigger samples and loops. It is as if the track is kept playing in the background while you pick out sections earlier in the track and play samples over the top, and when you have finished, the track snaps back, not to where you left it, but to where it has progressed to. You can use this feature to replace whole loops with other loops in the track and keep the rhythm of the track going. It is really powerful.</p>
<p>There is a four knob ‘FX’ section above each jog wheel. This is used to add FX such as delay, reverb, flanger, and so on. I don’t find myself using this much for my style of DJing. I do wonder how much of the FX and pad hammering you can actually do to a track before you start to annoy your crowd. They are great to use occasionally though.</p>
<p>Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. I had a pair of Pioneer CDJ400s and mixer back in 2009 which had a lot less features and cost over twice the price as this unit, and yet had the same build quality. Even if you ignore the ‘which is better’ argument of digital DJing versus CDJs, if you already have a laptop, this is a great setup for the money.</p>

      <title>New Synthesiser Additions: Microbrute, Nord Drum and Access Virus A</title>

      <description>I bought some new synths.
Access Virus A This is the original 1998 Access Virus A. It, it was a staple synth for trance and electronic music in general for the early 00s. I am very happy that I managed to get this secondhand for less than a MicroKORG. It cost over £800 when it came out in 1998. Old digital synths seem to be unpopular at the moment, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard comments along the lines of &amp;lsquo;if it&amp;rsquo;s digital then I might as well use a plugin in my DAW&amp;rsquo;.</description>

<h3 id="access-virus-a">Access Virus A</h3>
<p>This is the original <a href="http://www.vintagesynth.com/misc/virusa.php">1998 Access Virus A</a>. It, it was a staple synth for trance and electronic music in general for the early 00s. I am very happy that I managed to get this secondhand for less than a MicroKORG. It cost over £800 when it came out in 1998. Old digital synths seem to be unpopular at the moment, I&rsquo;ve heard comments along the lines of &lsquo;if it&rsquo;s digital then I might as well use a plugin in my DAW&rsquo;. But I think this is ignoring the tactile control surface that you get, and how it gets your head outside the computer and playing an actual physical instrument. The presets are really inspiring, several sounds that you will recognise if you were into electronic music in the 00s. VNV Nation, one of my favourite bands, produced their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDPwv0n8LzY">entire &lsquo;Empires&rsquo; album</a> with just the Access Virus A and a couple of samplers.</p>
<p>It has two oscillators which have extra functionality, as you can choose the waveform from a large selection of presampled waveforms, in addition to the usual sawtooth, sine, square. There is also a suboscilator, two filters, each with a ASDTR configurable envelope, the usual ASDTR for the amplifier, and three LFOs. You can choose to map the LFOs to almost anything, allowing a great amount of flexibility. It also has effects - delay and unison, as well as multiple timbers, meaning that you can have up to 12 different patches playing at the same time, each controlled with different MIDI channels. The whole thing is extensively controllable via MIDI also. It is my first polyphonic hardware synthesier, and so has opened up a whole range of new composition possibilities around chords.</p>
<h3 id="microbrute">Microbrute</h3>
<p>The Microbrute is fully analogue, and it can produce a good number of sounds through its one oscilator, by allowing you to blend in different quantities of sawtooth, sine and square, along with some extensive extras, such as a metalizer. It has a Steiner Parker filter, a LFO and a step sequencer. You can get more technical details about the Microbrute in Marc Doty&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R_b2f74uZE&amp;list=RD3R_b2f74uZE#t=41">great series of videos</a>.</p>
<p>It has a hard aggressive character to the sound, especially when used with the &lsquo;brute factor&rsquo;. I like its sound, but sometimes wish for a little bit more warmth. However you can make all sorts of sounds with it, and I particularly like making chiptune arpeggio with the square wave, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cachebuster/blue-sky">such as in my track &lsquo;Blue Sky&rsquo;</a>.</p>
<p>It also has a mod matrix that I haven&rsquo;t fully explored yet, but is very powerful, especially if you want to link it up to other CV capable synths.</p>
<h3 id="nord-drum">Nord Drum</h3>
<p>This is an analgoue modelling drum synthesiser. It is the first Nord Drum so it only has four channels, but the presets sound great in the mix. I haven&rsquo;t even looked at the synthesis options on this yet, as I&rsquo;ve been really happy with the presets, but there is a whole range of options that you can shape and edit for your own sound.</p>
<h3 id="my-synth-shelf">My synth &lsquo;shelf&rsquo;</h3>
<p>I have swapped out the older synths that I don&rsquo;t use anymore. Currently I&rsquo;m using the three synths above. The keyboard at the top is my Alesis Q25 MIDI controller, there is a ZED 10 mixer on the middle shelf which I use as a recording device, as well as a gold EMU Orbit which I don&rsquo;t have plugged in at the moment.</p>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve had the idea of creating a text-based Roguelike in C++. This lead me on to think about the game AI experiments that I worked during my degree in Computer Science and A.I.. Essential to game AI is the notion of pathfinding, or finding a path from &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;B&amp;rsquo;, past any obstacles that get in the way. One way to do this is to use the A* algorithm.</description>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve had the idea of creating a text-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">Roguelike</a> in C++. This lead me on to think about the game AI experiments that I worked during my degree in <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/">Computer Science and A.I.</a>. Essential to game AI is the notion of pathfinding, or finding a path from &lsquo;A&rsquo; to &lsquo;B&rsquo;, past any obstacles that get in the way. One way to do this is to use the A* algorithm. I decided to implement an A* pathfinding algorithm for possible use in a Roguelike later, and chose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">the pseudocode from the Wikipedia example</a> to implement.</p>
<p>The program finds a path from the top right hand corner to the top left, avoiding impassable &lsquo;7&rsquo; obstacles. The &lsquo;*&rsquo; are the steps along the path. The algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest path between the goal and the start, which means it can optimally solve any solvable maze, given time.</p>

      <description>I like to dabble in making and playing music. Here is the equipment and setup that I use.
Ableton Live Intro
This is the DAW I use. I have been using Ableton Live for several years now, and I know my way around it. I have tried others but they never really felt as comfortable. Live comes in three flavours, &amp;lsquo;Intro&amp;rsquo; is the most basic paid-for version. I was surprised how cheap the &amp;lsquo;Intro&amp;rsquo; version was, and how little I find myself needing the features of the more expensive versions.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like to dabble in making and playing music. Here is the equipment and setup that I use.</p>
<p><strong>Ableton Live Intro</strong></p>
<p>This is the DAW I use. I have been using Ableton Live for several years now, and I know my way around it. I have tried others but they never really felt as comfortable. <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/feature-comparison/">Live comes in three flavours</a>, &lsquo;Intro&rsquo; is the most basic paid-for version. I was surprised how cheap the &lsquo;Intro&rsquo; version was, and how little I find myself needing the features of the more expensive versions. I only have one paid-for VST plugin, and that is the KORG Legacy Cell MS-20, which I use on almost all the music I&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p><strong>KORG Electribe R-1 MK2 Analog Modelling Drum Synthesiser</strong></p>
<p>This is what serves as my drum machine. I picked it up on the cheap, but I&rsquo;m really happy with it. I really like the built in step sequencer, and the drum synth itself. The sounds you can make from it are quite varied, and I really like the way you can put together live compositions on the fly. I&rsquo;d be interested in getting some more KORG boxes, such as the <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov03/articles/korgemx1.htm">EMX Electribes</a> or the Volcas.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/korg-electribe-er1-mk2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/korg-electribe-er1-mk2.jpg" type="" alt="korg-electribe-er1-mk2"  /></a><strong>Waldorf Rocket Monophonic Analogue Sythnesiser module</strong></p>
<p>This is my analogue synthesiser, which I use mainly for leads. In practice I find it quite annoying not being able to play real chords, and the lack of a sequencer is difficult because it means I can&rsquo;t put together patterns away from the PC, or even really play it without a keyboard. I do like the sound, and the filter is great. The &lsquo;fake chords&rsquo; option is great fun I just wish you could more easily change between the chords on the fly. The arp is pretty cool also. I think this will become a lot more awesome when I get a hardware sequencer, I already have my eye on the cheap <a href="http://www.arturia.com/evolution/en/products/BeatStep/intro.html">BeatStep</a> to pick up when it is released.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/waldorfrocket-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/waldorfrocket-1.jpg" type="" alt="WALDORF&#43;ROCKET-1"  /></a><strong>KORG Monotribe Analogue Sythesiser and Drum Machine</strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really use this for anything, unfortunately. It was my first synthesiser and although I liked it at the time, nowadays I find the lack of MIDI and the ribbon keyboard a major problem. I might either sell it or get a MIDI mod and install it. I find it quite noisey when recording anyway, so maybe I&rsquo;ll just try and sell it. It does has some nice acid style sounds though. A shame.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/monotribe.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/monotribe.jpg" type="" alt="monotribe"  /></a><strong>Yamaha P35 Digital Piano</strong></p>
<p>I was looking for a decent MIDI out keyboard that would allow me to put together more complex melodies and learn how to play keyboards for possibly joining a band in the future. The Yamaha NP31, which was my original choice, was out of stock and so it got me looking at others. I thought it would be interesting to learn to play the piano, as we had one growing up but I never really learned before. In the store I really liked the feel of the P35&rsquo;s hammer action keys, so decided to buy it. I can play some simple tunes with it but want to get piano lessons so I can improve. This will also function as my main MIDI controller for my other hardware.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/717azc6biwl-_sl1500_.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/717azc6biwl-_sl1500_.jpg" type="" alt="717aZc6BIwL.&lt;em&gt;SL1500&lt;/em&gt;"  /></a><strong>Line 6 Mobile Keys 25 USB Keyboard Controller</strong></p>
<p>This is a nice little keyboard controller that I use with Ableton. Unfortunately it does not have MIDI out, only MIDI via USB, but I can run it through the MIDISport to control audio hardware. The keyboard action is very nice, much better than the M-Audio Keystation 49 which I had before and would not recommend.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/controller.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/controller.jpeg" type="" alt="controller"  /></a><strong>M-Audio MIDISport Anniversary Edition 2x2 MIDI/USB Interface</strong></p>
<p>This is a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/M-Audio-Midisport-2x2-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B001D5D454/">fairly standard cheap MIDI to USB interface</a>. I used to use the M-Audio Uno, but that has only one input/output and it has problems with some audio hardware.</p>

      <title>Setting up Kindlefire HDX for Development under Ubuntu 12.04</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2014/02/10/kindlefire-hdx-under-ubuntu-12-04/</link>

      <description>I wanted to get a Kindlefire HDX running under Ubuntu 12.04 with adb.
First I needed to setup the udev rules:
1. Edit /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules as root, and add the following line (create this file if it does not exist):
SUBSYSTEM==&amp;#34;usb&amp;#34;, ATTRS{idVendor}==&amp;#34;1949&amp;#34;, MODE=&amp;#34;0666&amp;#34; 2. Change the permission of this file by executing the following command as root:
chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules 3. Reload the rules by executing the following command as root:</description>

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>SUBSYSTEM==&#34;usb&#34;, ATTRS{idVendor}==&#34;1949&#34;, MODE=&#34;0666&#34;

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>4. Run these commands to restart adb:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>adb kill-server

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>lsusb
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I can see the device listed.</p>
<p>6. Next I needed to enable adb access on the Kindlefire HDX device itself by going to <strong>Settings -&gt; Device -&gt; Enable ADB</strong>.</p>
<p>7. Finally I could run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>adb devices
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>within Ubuntu and have it recognise the Kindlefire HDX.</p>

      <description>Updated: Reorganised, replaced Tiamat headset for KAVE.
I use my computer a lot, for work (software development), gaming and music production. I wanted to build a high-end computer setup, as I&amp;rsquo;ve always lagged behind with upgrades before. So I gradually have been accumulating and swapping bits around to make the setup above.

<h4 id="case---thermaltake-level-10-gt-full-tower">Case - Thermaltake Level 10 GT Full Tower</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thermaltake-Level-Full-Tower-Gaming/dp/B004MQBQ1A">[Link to Amazon]</a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/case.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/case.jpg" type="" alt="case"  /></a></p>
<p>This was an expensive case, but I wanted to spend some money to get a quality case that I could use for future builds. It has many fans, most of which I don&rsquo;t need, but they are very quiet and they make the CPU temperate a very cool 30-40 degrees, under regular load, even in the current heatwave we&rsquo;re having. The case has 5 hotswappable hard drive caddies which is very nice and allows me to easily install and remove hard drives without having to take apart the computer. It also has a lock, USB3 ports and enough clearance for graphic cards and space for lots of upgrades.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="motherboard---gigabyte-z77x-d3h-1155">Motherboard - Gigabyte Z77X-D3H 1155</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-D3H-SKT-1155-Z77X-D3H-Motherboard/dp/B007KZQFEI">[Link to Amazon]</a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/mobo.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/mobo.jpg" type="" alt="mobo"  /></a></p>
<p>This was bought because it was a cheapish seat for the Ivy Bridge processor and the 16GB RAM. It has some niceish features, such as the fancy 3D BIOS which you can navigate with a mouse, and the onboard graphics which is enough to get into the BIOS when your graphics card isn&rsquo;t working. The onboard sound is best avoided.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="cpu---intel-core-i7-3770-34ghz-quad-core">CPU - Intel Core i7 (3770) 3.4GHz Quad Core</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Intel-3-4GHz-Processor-Cache-Speed/dp/B007RMH1WY">[Link to Amazon]</a></p>
<p>This was the processor that was the top of the mainstream mid-high end CPUs when I was purchasing. It differs from the 3770k as you can&rsquo;t overclock it, but it has decent support for hardware virtualisation, which I wanted and is not available in the 3770k. I figured I wouldn&rsquo;t miss the chance to overclock this for a good while, as CPUs of this type already are vastly overpowered for the applications that I use. CPU utilisation for typical use (not including games) rarely rises above 10%.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="cpu-cooler---arctic-cooling-freezer-13-pro">CPU Cooler - Arctic Cooling Freezer 13 Pro</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Arctic-Cooling-Freezer-Pro-Cooler/dp/B0047V8E1K">[Link to Amazon]</a></p>
<p>This is a bit overspecced since I am not planning to overclock, but I don&rsquo;t like stock heatsinks and so bought this. It is a huge heatsink and probably wouldn&rsquo;t fit in many other types of cases, but as I have a full tower it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="ram---16gb-ddr3-ram-ballistix-ddr3-pc3-17000">RAM - 16GB DDR3 RAM Ballistix DDR3 PC3-17000</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.crucial.com/eu/store/mpartspecs.aspx?mtbpoid=4F7BBB48A5CA7304">[Link to Crucial]</a></p>
<p>This is fast RAM for gaming. 16GB is a bit overspecced for my current needs, but it&rsquo;s the maximum my board will take, and means I won&rsquo;t have to upgrade for a long while.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="wireless-card---tp-link-tl-wdn4800-n900-wireless-dual-band-pci-express-adapter">Wireless Card - TP-LINK TL-WDN4800 N900 Wireless Dual Band PCI Express Adapter</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/TP-LINK-TL-WDN4800-Wireless-Express-Adapter/dp/B006PMX964">[Link to Amazon]</a></p>
<p>This wireless card is good because it has dual-band, meaning faster, interference free 5GHz spectrum access to my dual-band wireless router, and because it has three external ariels which you can replace. I have got a large indoor antenna replacement which allows me to double my wireless range, meaning I can pick up local wifi hotspots if needed.</p>

<h4 id="optical-drive---pioneer-bdr-207dbk-12x-internal-bd-rw-burner">Optical Drive - Pioneer BDR-207DBK 12x Internal BD-RW Burner</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pioneer-BDR-207DBK-Internal-BD-RW-Burner/dp/B0075WEPJI">[Link to Amazon]</a></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really need a Blu-Ray burner, but it&rsquo;s useful for backups and I thought I could write some discs to be played in my PS3. It has a very fast read speed for reading Blu-Rays and burning DVDs. To be honest I could have gone for a Blu-ray reader and DVD writer combo and not really noticed the difference.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="psu---850w-evga-super-nova-gold-modular">PSU - 850W EVGA Super NOVA Gold Modular</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/EVGA-Super-NOVA-Power-Supply/dp/B00J299ALA">[Link to Amazon]</a></p>
<p>850W allows a lot of headroom for graphics cards&rsquo; power requirements, and extra components in the future. It is a good quality PSU and is fully modular which is a lot nicer to work with.</p>

<h4 id="3x-hard-drives-----1x-crucial-ct256m4ssd2baa-256gb-ssd-1x-unknown-model-crucial-120gb-ssd-1x-seagate-3tb-35-inch-7200rpm-64mb-cache-sata3-hard-drive">3x Hard Drives -   1x Crucial CT256M4SSD2BAA 256GB SSD 1x Unknown model Crucial 120GB SSD 1x Seagate 3TB 3.5 inch 7200RPM 64MB Cache SATA3 Hard Drive</h4>
<p>The 256GB SSD is my system drive, the older 120GB SSD is for games, and the 3TB HD is for storage: my music collection, video files collection, backup images and virtual machines. Being SSDs, the 256GB and 120GB drives are totally silent, making the 3TB HD sound really loud when it spins up. However, the 3TB drive has enough space to store full Blu-Ray ripped files.. not that I would do that, of course :)</p>

<h4 id="monitor---benq-bl3200pt-amva-1440p-32-widescreen">Monitor - BenQ BL3200PT AMVA+ 1440p 32&quot; Widescreen</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00JIWLNHU">[Link to Amazon]</a></p>
<p>This is a high-end 1440p 32&quot; monitor. It has made such a big difference to using the PC, more screen space, more pixels and better clarity. I was considering a 4K monitor, but don&rsquo;t think the technology is quite cheap enough yet, and the software and games support is severely lacking. It&rsquo;s 60HZ refresh rate, but that is enough for me. I have heard that the higher refresh rate monitors are better for gaming, but a 144HZ 1440p 32&quot; monitor would be way out of my budget, not to mention the graphics processing power it would require to run.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="graphics-card--asus-strix-gtx-980-4gb-gddr5">Graphics Card – Asus STRIX GTX 980 4GB GDDR5</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/STRIX-GTX980-DC2OC-4GD5-Nvidia-Graphics-GDDR5-Express/dp/B00O11Z0H2">[Link to Amazon]</a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/gpu.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/gpu.jpg" type="" alt="gpu"  /></a></p>
<p>I had to upgrade my old Nvidea GTX 660TI, and just went for the absolute maximum I could afford. The STRIX 980 is an amazing card and comes slightly overclocked compared to the reference model. It plays all current games on maximum settings on 1440p at over 30FPS, which is no a mean feat, on my resolution there is more than a million pixels being drawn to the screen on each frame.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="monitor-backlight---lightpack">Monitor Backlight - Lightpack</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.lightpack.tv">www.lightpack.tv</a></p>
<p>This is a monitor or TV backlighting kit that changes the colour of the light projected behind your screen to match the colours on the edges of your display. This provides a more immersive experience when playing games with the lights down, and you can also set it to become a graphic equaliser where the lights flash in time with the music. I bought this on a whim and I&rsquo;ve been quite impressed with it so far. It definitely adds to immersion and the graphic equaliser mode is rather trippy when writing or playing music.</p>

<h4 id="headphones---sennheiser-hd-25-1-iis">Headphones - Sennheiser HD 25-1 IIs</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD25-1-II-Closed-Back-Headphones/dp/B000TDZOXG">[Link to Amazon]</a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/headphones.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/headphones.jpg" type="" alt="headphones"  /></a></p>
<p>These are what I use when I can&rsquo;t use my speakers. I bought them for DJing and audio work. They have great sound isolation (these are used by sports commentators you see on TV, because when you&rsquo;ve got them on, you literally can only hear what&rsquo;s coming through the headphones) and great sound quality (a favourite for top DJs and sound engineers). They don&rsquo;t look that great though, and aren&rsquo;t the most comfortable, but whatever. One nice feature is that they are designed for heavy use and are almost indestructable. If someone steps on the headphone lead, they won&rsquo;t break, the cables will just pop out of the cans. If the headset breaks, well you can remove the cans and just buy a new headset. They have high &lsquo;sound pressure&rsquo; which means the ratio of sound that enters your ear versus the amount of sound that comes out of the cans, is quite high due to their closed nature and sound isolating design. This, combined with high frequency range and a large volume range, means it&rsquo;s quite easy to cause yourself hearing damage if you have them on too loud usually, or if you have a temporary high volume &lsquo;spike&rsquo;.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="soundcard--asus-rog-xonar-phoebus-solo">Soundcard – Asus ROG Xonar Phoebus Solo</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00CRRVL4S">[Link to Amazon]</a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/soundcard.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/soundcard.jpg" type="" alt="soundcard"  /></a></p>
<p>Good 7.1 surround sound card, with headphone amplifier.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="gaming-headset--roccat-kave-xtd-51-analogue">Gaming Headset – ROCCAT Kave XTD 5.1 Analogue</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00UHRXTM2">[Link to Amazon]</a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/headset1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/headset1.jpg" type="" alt="headset"  /></a></p>
<p>It is quite difficult to find surround sound headsets with analogue inputs, most headsets are USB only, and contain their own soundcard. This is not ideal when you have a really good soundcard already that you want to use, such as my Xonar Phoebus Solo. Previously I was using the Razer Tiamat, which was terrible. It had a consistant high-pitched electrical whine when you were wearing the headset, and you couldn&rsquo;t get rid of it. The Kave is much better in this regard, and is more comfortable too. It is &lsquo;only&rsquo; 5.1 compared to the Tiamat&rsquo;s 7.1, but really, 7.1 surround sound in a headset is just a marketing tactic anyway, you are never going to be able to appreciate the extra two channels when the speakers are that close together.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="speakers--krk-rokit-g2-5">Speakers – KRK Rokit G2 5</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/KRK-Rokit-Monitor-Speakers-Pair/dp/B003SQ49YQ">[Link to Amazon]</a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/speakers.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/speakers.jpg" type="" alt="speakers"  /></a></p>
<p>These are great monitors, which I use for music production, and make for great speakers for general use as well. They are a little large for my desk and have a maximum volume which is far too loud for my flat, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be without them.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="speaker-stands---isoacoustics-l8r155-speaker-stands">Speaker Stands - IsoAcoustics L8R155 Speaker Stands</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/IsoAcoustics-L8R155-Speaker-Stands-pair/dp/B008GOP79G">[Link to Amazon]</a></p>
<p>These are sound-isolating speaker stands, which I have setup to raise the speakers to ear height. I have to say, they&rsquo;ve made the speakers sound so much better, and they look good too.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="mixer---allen--heath-zed-10">Mixer - Allen &amp; Heath ZED 10</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Allen-amp-Heath-ZED-10-Mixer/dp/B003U747Z4">[Link to Amazon]</a></p>
<p>This is a good recording mixer which also doubles as a great USB soundcard. It has 4x mono RCA inputs and 2x stereo RCA inputs, which is enough to wire all my synths up, as well as feed the Rokit 5s.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="desktop-microphone---pulse-50s-retro-chrome-style-microphone">Desktop Microphone - Pulse 50&rsquo;s Retro Chrome Style Microphone</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0013NCY3Y">[Link to Amazon]</a></p>
<p>This is a 50&rsquo;s style microphone that I liked the look of. I got it because I wanted a microphone that plugged into my mixing desk, which would allow me to talk hands-free on Skype. Also it is good for streaming games, as I can mix my voice in the microphone with the output the computer game sounds, and send both mixed to skype or Twitch.TV or wherever. It is also moderately useful for recording voices for music production and for routing via my FX pedal for some novelty vocal effects on Skype, such as delay, echo and reverb.</p>

<p>This is the model with the quieter Cherry MX Brown key switches. It is a good mechanical keyboard for all purposes, looks good, and will encourage me to type more accurately. I grew annoyed at missing keys on the blank keycaps, so I added my own coloured keycaps for high visibility (see picture at top).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.razerzone.com/eu-en/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-orbweaver-stealth/">[Link to Razer Site]</a></p>
<p>This is the &lsquo;Stealth&rsquo; model with the Cherry MX Brown key switches. I was initially doubtful whether it was worth getting a gaming keypad, but so many people have recommended it, that I had to try it out. I actually have found it very useful, much more comfortable and accurate than using a normal keyboard for gaming. It also forces you to get into the habit of remapping keys for your own preference.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="mouse---logitech-g9x">Mouse - Logitech G9X</h4>

<p>I upgraded from my G500 mouse to this, smaller, G9X. I have started to adopt <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/mouseguide/ergonomic/clawgrip">the claw grip</a> for gaming and generally using my mouse. This makes the larger G500 difficult to use, as the larger size means that the mouse buttons don&rsquo;t click properly when you have your fingers higher up on the mouse. So far, I am very happy with the G9X, the higher DPI scanning, and the easier to grip &lsquo;precicse grip&rsquo; material means that it is better for other reasons for me.</p>
<p>I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00BF9MZZI/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1#productDetails">Corsair Vengeance</a> mouse matt, it is made of metal unlike my previous Razor Golliathus cloth one, which I didn&rsquo;t like because the edge of the matt would get stuck in the mouse when you moved it too far.</p>

      <description>A good ergonomic chair is a wise investment if you&amp;rsquo;re going to spend a lot of time at your computer. One of the better known ergonomic models is the Herman Miller Aeron Task Chair.
What Other People Say About the Aeron Jeff Atwood (from Coding Horror) says:
In fact, after browsing chairs for the last few years of my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to one conclusion: you can&amp;rsquo;t expect to get a decent chair for less than $500.</description>

<h3 id="what-other-people-say-about-the-aeron">What Other People Say About the Aeron</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/07/investing-in-a-quality-programming-chair.html">Jeff Atwood</a> (from Coding Horror) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, after browsing chairs for the last few years of my career, I&rsquo;ve come to one conclusion: you can&rsquo;t expect to get a decent chair for less than $500. If you are spending less than that on seating – unless you are getting the deal of the century on dot-bomb bankruptcy auctions – you&rsquo;re probably making a mistake.</p>
<p>I still believe this to be true, and I urge any programmers reading this to seriously consider the value of what you&rsquo;re sitting in while you&rsquo;re on the job. In our profession, seating matters:</p>
<p>Chairs are a primary part of the programming experience. Eight hours a day, every day, for the rest of your working life – you&rsquo;re sitting in one. Like it or not, whatever you&rsquo;re sitting in has a measurable impact on your work experience.</p>
<p>Cheap chairs suck. Maybe I&rsquo;ve become spoiled, but I have yet to sit in a single good, cheap chair. In my experience, the difference between the really great chairs and the cheap stuff is enormous. A quality chair is so comfortable and accommodating it effortlessly melts into the background, so you can focus on your work. A cheesy, cheap chair constantly reminds you how many hours of work you have left.</p>
<p>Chairs last. As I write this, I&rsquo;m still sitting my original Aeron chair, which I purchased in 1998. I can&rsquo;t think of any other piece of equipment I use in my job that has lasted me ten full years and beyond. While the initial sticker shock of a quality chair may turn you off, try to mentally amortize that cost across the next ten years or more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html">Joel Spolsky</a> (from Joel On Software) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me, for a moment, talk about the famous Aeron chair, made by Herman Miller. They cost about $900. This is about $800 more than a cheap office chair from OfficeDepot or Staples.</p>
<p>They are much more comfortable than cheap chairs. If you get the right size and adjust it properly, most people can sit in them all day long without feeling uncomfortable. The back and seat are made out of a kind of mesh that lets air flow so you don’t get sweaty. The ergonomics, especially of the newer models with lumbar support, are excellent.</p>
<p>They last longer than cheap chairs. We’ve been in business for six years and every Aeron is literally in mint condition: I challenge anyone to see the difference between the chairs we bought in 2000 and the chairs we bought three months ago. They easily last for ten years. The cheap chairs literally start falling apart after a matter of months. You’ll need at least four $100 chairs to last as long as an Aeron.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=585693">a post with a large set of comments</a> on Hacker News about chairs and cheap alternatives to Aeron Chairs, with a lot of people saying that there is no cheap alternative to a good chair.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-say-about-the-aeron">What I Say About the Aeron</h3>
<p>I just got a refurbished Aeron chair for Christmas. I am really pleased with it. It comes in three base sizes, being larger than normal I went for the Size C. Once it arrived it was a good fit, but it was easily configurable to make it into an excellent fit. I prefer my chair not to recline, so I can&rsquo;t comment on whether it is not a good chair for reclining, as Jeff Atwood says, but I will say it felt comfortable and stable reclining.</p>
<p>The real benefit so far has been on my posture; I did not know how much back pain I was having before with my really cheap office chair. Only when I got up from a 4 hour session on my Aeron chair did I notice how much better my back was feeling. It moulds your back into a good position, and I have noticed my back clicking and popping into its proper shape, after using the chair for a couple of days.</p>
<p>I ordered my chair from <a href="http://simplyaeron.co.uk">simplyaeron.co.uk</a>, who I am very happy with, as they provided an MK2 Size C chair with lumbar support for less than £400, which is an absolute bargain compared to the retail price of a new chair. This also included delivery! It seems like new - there are no scuff marks and everything works perfectly.</p>
<p>I highly recommend getting an Aeron chair or an equivalent ergonomic chair recommended in the above resources, as I have really noticed a significant difference.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2015 Update: The &ldquo;Device Hive&rdquo; project has now been changed to be called &lsquo;Hive CI&rsquo; and it is being maintained by a team of developers at the BBC, which I am no longer a part of. It is in the process of being opensourced, see: <a href="http://bbc.github.io/hive-ci/">http://bbc.github.io/hive-ci/</a></p>
<p>This year has been quite a busy and eventful one for me.</p>
<p><strong>Connected Red Button</strong> At the start of the year, I was working on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/posts/connected_red_button_launch">Connected Red Button</a> team within the BBC. Connected Red Button is a major ongoing project in the Television and Mobile Platforms department at BBC North. Its aim is to replace the classic Red Button text service (which itself is the successor to Ceefax) with a new updated all-singing all-dancing interactive portal to internet content, available on Smart TVs and modern set top boxes. Currently Connected Red Button is live and accessible by pressing the Red Button on the new Virgin Media TiVo boxes. You can access the latest version of iPlayer, and the BBC News and BBC Sport smart TV apps from within one easy portal.</p>
<p>On CRB, I was working on the Java/Spring services layer, which connects to the various APIs of services like iPlayer that we have at the BBC, and gets all the content ready for the frontend. This data then gets passed to the very nice looking AS2 frontend to display, and that&rsquo;s how it appears on your TV that is connected to your Virgin TiVo box in your living room.</p>
<p>The next version of CRB is being developed for Smart TVs with HTML browsers (so the frontend is in HTML5/JS instead of AS2). This type of Smart TV includes most of the new smart TVs that have come out recently, and will continue to be released in the future. The BBC (and the wider industry) is really anticipating that most TVs will be smart TVs in 5-10 years, and so the reach of Connected Red Button HTML will increase substantially so that most of the audience can be served by new applications that run on smart TVs.</p>
<p><strong>Smartbridge</strong></p>
<p>Smartbridge is the transitional frontend that is displayed to both 1) users that have smart TVs and internet connected STB (Set Top Boxes) capable of running our latest BBC applications such as Connected Red Button and the latest versions of iPlayer, and also 2) our traditional users that still have normal (un-smart) TVs that can only receive Broadcast Red Button (the service you get by pressing the red button on any BBC channel). Smartbridge is not a branded BBC product, it is the behind the scenes magic that helps ensure that we maintain the availability of traditional Red Button services as we simultaneously launch and develop Connected Red Button.</p>
<p>For several months this year I was working on Smarbridge. On Smartbridge, I was working to get the project released and out the door, which meant Java/Spring/Hibernate work, with MySQL database tinkering and some broadcast work configuring and testing the TVs that worked with Smartbridge. It was successfully released in October.</p>
<p><strong>Device Hive</strong></p>
<p>Device Hive is the working name for an BBC system that is an Android and iOS emulator and physical device testing platform. A server will run the Device Hive software, and mobile developers will be able to plug in their Android mobile or tablet or iPhone or iPad to the server via a USB cable, and choose an application to run on it, such as BBC iPlayer or BBC Radio Player. This application will then automatically be downloaded onto the device, and the automated Cucumber/Calabash test suite will be executed, which will step through every screen of the mobile application, triggering buttons, scrolling up and down and generally exercising every aspect of the mobile application. There will also be an option to run install and run applications on Android or iOS emulators, so we could have 10 emulators running at once, each running different segments of the automated test suite, and uploading the test results to a logging server.</p>
<p>Device Hive will mean, in particular, that we can test BBC mobile applications on the plethora of Android devices available, every make and model that we own of the different OS/hardware combinations can be plugged into a device hive server, and so we can see test runs for BBC iPlayer Android across all the different variations. This will mean we can help target a wider range of Android devices for new BBC iPlayer features, which will help ease the anger that some of our audience members feel because their specific Android iPlayer experience is not as good as the later models.</p>
<p>In October I moved departments from Television and Mobile Platforms to POD Test, and joined the new Device Hive team as lead developer. I am working in Ruby/Rails/Rspec/Cucumber and using Ubuntu Linux VMs and lots of Android and iOS devices to build up the system.</p>
<p><strong>University Engagement</strong></p>
<p>I have been continuing to work with Manchester University&rsquo;s <a href="http://man-up.appspot.com/">Ultimate Programming Society</a> to organise and present talks to the students about working practices in software development that the BBC use. We have covered Behaviour Driven Development, Test Driven Development, Editors and IDEs and Agile Development Practices so far.</p>
<p>Generally I feel that I have worked on some pretty challenging projects this year, and I am very happy with being the lead developer on Device Hive, and look forward to making this project as useful and as powerful as I think it can be.</p>

      <title>Android Debug Bridge failing to detect emulators under OSX</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a project at the BBC where we are using the Android command-line tools from the Android Developer Tools, to spin up and terminate series of emulators. I noticed a big problem under OSX where &amp;lsquo;adb devices&amp;rsquo; was failing to register emulators occasionally when we started them up, without any error message, even though they were loaded and quite clearly running in a window on OSX. This was a real problem for our project because we needed absolute parity between emulator process being launched and subsequently being detected by adb.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/android.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/android.png" type="" alt="Android"  /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a project at the BBC where we are using the Android command-line tools from the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/index.html">Android Developer Tools</a>, to spin up and terminate series of emulators. I noticed a big problem under OSX where &lsquo;adb devices&rsquo; was failing to register emulators occasionally when we started them up, without any error message, even though they were loaded and quite clearly running in a window on OSX. This was a real problem for our project because we needed absolute parity between emulator process being launched and subsequently being detected by adb.</p>
<p>We switched to using adb with emulators in an Ubuntu 12.04 VM running under OSX, and we had no further problems with our setup. Emulators will now be programatically launched and torn down by our monitoring application. We now have an array of emulators which we can deploy to at will, which is very useful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what has caused this problem, my only hunch is that the Android toolkit was probably developed in a very Linux-heavy environment, and so adb on Linux was probably their first testing platform. All I can say is that Linux is much more stable than OSX, even as a VM, for Android emulation.</p>

      <description>I found this awesome cut-up poetry generator, which takes the text of famous poets and builds structured poetry out of it. The guy that made it even developed the underlying algorithm as a research project. I have put a version of a free Amazon EC2 instance, wrote a little twitter bot in node.js, and wired the poetry generator with the twitter bot, and now I have this: https://twitter.com/haikumachine - a twitter bot that posts a haiku every five minutes, derived from Dylan Thomas&amp;rsquo;s poetry.</description>

      <description>To get 256 colors working within terminator in Crunchbang Waldorf, I had to do the following:
Add to ~/.bashrc
export TERM=xterm-256color Install a 256 color VIM colorcheme, see desert256 for example.
Add the following to ~/.vimrc:
set t_Co=256 set t_AB=^[[48;5;%dm set t_AF=^[[38;5;%dm &amp;rsquo;t_Co&amp;rsquo; specifies exactly how many colours VIM can use. The other two lines seem to be Debian-specific color code escape sequences.
If you want 256 color VIM for your root user when you sudo edit, then edit /usr/share/vim/vimrc and copy across your settings from your local ~/.</description>

      <description>I use the excellent http://www.smartsvn.com/ client from WANdisco. WANdisco have been releasing new open-source versions of SVN to the public with new improved reliability, and the client uses one of these versions, 1.7, to offer better performance.
Unfortunately if you choose to upgrade your entire repository to 1.7, this breaks compatibility with the default commandline SVN client on Waldorf which I like to use as well as Smart SVN, for quick &amp;lsquo;svn up&amp;rsquo;s and other commandline magic.</description>

<p>This means I have to download the latest commandline SVN client, the 1.7 version of subversion for Linux, available for free on the WANdisco site.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t install this version on the version of Debian that Crunchbang Waldorf is based on. There are broken dependencies on an old version of libsvn1, which is a requirement for another package that is part of the Debian base install.</p>
<p>Eventually I found this really helpful page, the instructions which will work 100% on Waldorf:</p>

      <title>iTerm for OSX for a Colourful Terminal Experience</title>

      <description>iTerm is much better than the standard OSX terminal client, not least because it has compatiablity with xterm256-color terminal emulation. xterm256-color emulation will give your terminal access to 256 colours instead of the usual 16. Much better, not just for looking pretty, but for distinguishing between different types of data in an editor like VIM or even in Cucumber output (see picture above). It&amp;rsquo;s also free.
http://iterm.sourceforge.net
Once installed, you will have to go in to the preferences and set your &amp;lsquo;Report Terminal Type&amp;rsquo; to be &amp;lsquo;xterm256-color&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>A quick tip this, but a useful one. You can tail a log file in the background while running a script in the foreground. So for example, I frequently execute the following commands:
1.
tail -f /var/log/httpd.log &amp;amp; /etc/init.d/apache restart 2. (The log file will spool onto the terminal as Apache is restarted.)
3. Once you are finished viewing the log file, foreground the log file process and kill it:</description>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then terminate the foregrounded log tail with a control-c.</p>
<p>With this technique you can run as many commands as you want, and see the real-time effects on your log file, without having to open a new terminal. You will also see your program output interspersed with your log file output, which can be helpful when tracing down particular problems.</p>

      <description>I am currently on holiday in Tenerife, and although I really like it here, one thing I do not like is the internet connection we have in our resort. Sometimes networked applications will just hang with no warning and there will be minutes where it&amp;rsquo;s not clear what is going on. Here are some ways you can find a little bit more about what is happening when an application is slow or seems to hang when you have a poor internet connection.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am currently on holiday in Tenerife, and although I really like it here, one thing I do not like is the internet connection we have in our resort. Sometimes networked applications will just hang with no warning and there will be minutes where it&rsquo;s not clear what is going on. Here are some ways you can find a little bit more about what is happening when an application is slow or seems to hang when you have a poor internet connection. Execute the following commands each in a separate terminal window.</p>
<h3 id="log-files">Log Files</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-gdscript3" data-lang="gdscript3"><span style="display:flex;"><span>tail <span style="color:#f92672">-</span>f <span style="color:#f92672">/</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span><span style="color:#f92672">/</span>log<span style="color:#f92672">/*</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will give you an indication of what is happening in OSX. For example, I was installing the XCode Command Line Utils from within XCode. The installation progress information is severely lacking, it just shows a bar which moves from left to right. However I was able to find out what was happening by tailing the log files in /var/log, which provided me with an updated breakdown of the installer progress. You can exit tail by using Control-C which will return you to the shell.</p>
<h3 id="constant-ping">Constant Ping</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ping www.google.com
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When I have problems with my internet connection, I always keep a ping running in the background in a terminal. The interesting information here is the ICMP RTT time shown as the milliseconds next to the &rsquo;time&rsquo; label, and how many packets were dropped shown by the number of &lsquo;request timeout&rsquo; messages. Google does not mind you pinging it, just like hundreds of thousands of other people do, and so you can keep this up constantly, monitoring problems with your internet connection. When you get &rsquo;no route to host&rsquo; printed, this usually means that your gateway or wireless connection is down, which means you usually have to reestablish a connection manually.</p>
<h3 id="tcpdump">tcpdump</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo tcpdump en0 -vvv
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Do you really want to see what is happening on your computers network connection? Turn the floodgates on then, and use tcpdump. This will output information on each packet that your computer sends out and is received in a slightly Matrix-style torrent of information. If you are downloading something via an application or have a number of active web connections such as AJAX Facebook pages loaded, you would expect to see a lot of traffic. If you don&rsquo;t have a lot of traffic, and you&rsquo;re expecting a lot, then something may be wrong. You can use tcpdump to get a general feel of what data is being passed around, and to what IP address, which you can then look up later for more clarity. You can also use grep and some basic TCP/IP networking knowledge to find out what exactly is happening on the network level.</p>
<h3 id="network-connection-status-of-each-application">Network Connection Status of Each Application</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo lsof -i tcp
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Want to find out information about applications are using your internet connection, and the connection state of each TCP connection? Use lsof. You will be given the name of the application that is using each TCP connection, the IP address to which it is connected to, and the TCP connection state (established is good, time wait can be a problem sign). Run this regularly to check on the connection state of your programs. This won&rsquo;t monitor UDP connections, but should cover your web browsers.</p>
<p>Hopefully this information will give you a bit more insight into what is actually happening on your OSX machine when your internet connection is being unreliable and you want more information about what is going on. Once you have this information, you can use it to inform actions such as toggling the wireless off and on again to reestablish a connection, reloading webpages that have hung, restarting application downloads, or possibly finding a new hotel or resort with a better internet connection :)</p>

      <description>Recently, myself and two colleagues from the BBC, ran a session on Test Driven Development at the Manchester University &amp;lsquo;Ultimate Programming&amp;rsquo; society. The society is a gathering where students discuss cool things they have done with programming, and occasionally have guest speakers from industry. I found the society online and thought it would be great to get the BBC more involved in the local university happenings.
It is the first outreach project that I have undertaken, and it required a lot of preparation.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, myself and two colleagues from the BBC, ran a session on Test Driven Development at the Manchester University &lsquo;Ultimate Programming&rsquo; society. <a href="http://www.man-up.appspot.com/">The society</a> is a gathering where students discuss cool things they have done with programming, and occasionally have guest speakers from industry. I found the society online and thought it would be great to get the BBC more involved in the local university happenings.</p>
<p>It is the first outreach project that I have undertaken, and it required a lot of preparation. Our initial idea was to get students to implement the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search algorithm</a> in a practical session, using TDD. However after we had all implemented our own copy of the algorithm, and realised it had taken several hours each, we realised we&rsquo;d not have enough time in the 2 hour slot that we had.</p>
<p>Instead then, we went back to the tried and tested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">FizzBuzz</a> example, which is how I learned TDD at the BBC. This was nice and simple and relatively straightforward to implement in an hour practical session. The task was to implement FizzBuzz using write-the-tests-first TDD process, and we gave approximately 1 hour for the students to undertake this task. For the rest of the time we were going through our presentation and talking about how we use TDD and other development concepts at the BBC.</p>
<p>The session overall went quite well, and although it showed to me how difficult it is to present in front of a group of people for an hour, we had good feedback, and I think we really gave the students a different perspective on how to write code, one that a large section of them would not have been exposed to in a standard CS curriculum. We aim to do other talks, starting with the next one, which will be a session on how we use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD (Behaviour Driven Development)</a> at the BBC.</p>
<p>Here are the slides we put together for the presentation:</p>

      <title>Converting a single M2V frame into JPEG under OSX</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2012/04/12/converting-a-single-m2v-frame-into-jpeg/</link>

      <description>I needed to view a single frame of a m2v file that had been encoded by our designers for playing out on TV. The file name was .mpg but in actuality it was a single .m2v frame renamed to be a .mpg. Windows Media Player classic used to display the frame fine when I opened the file normally, under Windows XP. However now I have switched to a Mac, I have found that Quicktime and VLC refused to display the single frame.</description>

<p>I needed to view a single frame of a m2v file that had been encoded by our designers for playing out on TV. The file name was .mpg but in actuality it was a single .m2v frame renamed to be a .mpg. Windows Media Player classic used to display the frame fine when I opened the file normally, under Windows XP. However now I have switched to a Mac, I have found that Quicktime and VLC refused to display the single frame. I couldn&rsquo;t find a video player that would open the single frame. So I resorted to the command line version of ffmpeg, which I installed via macports, to convert this single frame to a jpg file to view as normal. This line worked a treat:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ffmpeg -i north.mpg -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:00:1 -s 1024x768 -r 1 -f mjpeg north.jpg
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Where &rsquo;north.mpg&rsquo; was the m2v file, and &rsquo;north.jpg&rsquo; was the output jpeg.</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>find -name *.mpg -exec ffmpeg -i {} -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:00:1 -s 1024x768 -r 1 -f mjpeg {}.jpg ;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Will go through all the mpg files in the current directory and below, and create their jpeg single frame equivalents, ie: for north.mpg it will create north.mpg.jpg.</p>

      <description>After I wrote a Java application in JDK 1.6, I was stuck for a while when I realised that the target deployment machine was Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4. RHEL4 does not support Java 1.6 in its default configuration.
Luckily I found this article on the CentOS wiki which included instructions on how to install Java 1.6 on CentOS 4. Remembering that RHEL4 and CentOS 4 are almost identical, I tried the method supplied, and it worked.</description>

      <title>Test Driven Systems Development with Nagios</title>

      <description>Nagios can be seen as a automated test tool for systems, just as you would have automated tests for software projects. In test driven development (TDD), you write the tests first, and then use those tests to build up a software project that you can have confidence that it works. We can use this method to build up systems, or networks of systems. Plan out which services and processes should be running on your new systems, and then implement Nagios tests for every one.</description>

      <title>JSoup Method for Page Scraping</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of writing a web scraper for the forums on Gaia Online. Previously, I used to use Python to develop web scrapers, with the very handy Python library BeautifulSoup. Java has an equivalent called JSoup.
Here I have written a class which is extended by each class in my project that wants to scrape HTML. This &amp;lsquo;Scraper&amp;rsquo; class deals with the fetching of the HTML and converting it into a JSoup tree to be navigated and have the data picked out of.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently in the process of writing a web scraper for the forums on <a href="http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum" title="Gaia Online">Gaia Online</a>. Previously, I used to use Python to develop web scrapers, with the very handy Python library <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" title="BeautifulSoup">BeautifulSoup</a>. Java has an equivalent called JSoup.</p>
<p>Here I have written a class which is extended by each class in my project that wants to scrape HTML. This &lsquo;Scraper&rsquo; class deals with the fetching of the HTML and converting it into a JSoup tree to be navigated and have the data picked out of. It advertises itself as a &lsquo;web spider&rsquo; type of web agent and also adds a 0-7 second random wait before fetching the page to make sure it isn&rsquo;t used to overload a web server. It also converts the entire page to ASCII, which may not be the best thing to do for multi-language web pages, but certainly has made the scraping of the English language site Gaia Online much easier.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>

      <description>At work, I still have to use Windows XP and Outlook 2003. I don&amp;rsquo;t particually mind this, except when I draft an email to someone and accidently I press Control-B instead of Control-V. Control-B will go ahead and send your partially composed email, resulting in some embarassment as you have to tell everyone to disregard it.
So I wanted to remove the &amp;lsquo;send email&amp;rsquo; shortcut keys in Outlook 2003. There are two ways of doing this, one involves editing your group policy, which is something only my IT administration team can do, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to involve them.</description>

<p>So I wanted to remove the &lsquo;send email&rsquo; shortcut keys in Outlook 2003. There are two ways of doing this, one involves editing your group policy, which is something only my IT administration team can do, and I didn&rsquo;t want to have to involve them. The other way is by making a change to your registry, which I will describe here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open up regedit, and browse to the following registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER -&gt; Software -&gt; Policies -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; office -&gt; 11.0 -&gt; outlook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then create a new key called: &ldquo;DisabledShortcutKeysCheckBoxes&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under that key, create two new String Values:
Name: CtrlB Data: 66,8
Name: CtrlEnter Data: 13,8</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then restart Outlook and those keys will be disabled.</p>

      <description>There is a problem I frequently encouter on Redhat/Fedora/CentOS systems with the output of the ls command. Under those distributions, the default setup is to display directories in a very dark colour. If you usually use a white foreground and a black background on your terminal client (such as Putty) then you will struggle to read the names of the directories under Redhat-based distributions.
There are two soloutions that I have used:</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a problem I frequently encouter on Redhat/Fedora/CentOS systems with the output of the <strong>ls</strong> command. Under those distributions, the default setup is to display directories in a very dark colour. If you usually use a white foreground and a black background on your terminal client (such as Putty) then you will struggle to read the names of the directories under Redhat-based distributions.</p>
<p>There are two soloutions that I have used:</p>
<p><strong>1. Change the colour settings in Putty</strong></p>
<p>If you use Putty, ticking &lsquo;Use System Colours&rsquo; here changes the &ldquo;white foreground, black background&rdquo; default into a &ldquo;white background, black foreground&rdquo;. This way you can at least read the console properly, good for a quick fix. You can also save these settings in putty to be the default for the host that you are connecting to, or even all hosts.</p>
<p><strong>2. Change the LS_COLORS directive temporarily in the shell.</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can ask the <strong>ls</strong> command to display directories and other entries in colours that you specify. You could add these lines to the bottom of your .bashrc to make these changes permanent, or if you are using a shared machine, just copy and paste the following lines into the terminal and they will change the colours to a reddish more visable set, until you logout. :</p>

      <description>I am moving to Manchester soon, and so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d get an idea of the housing market there by scraping all the Manchester Gumtree property adverts into a MySQL database. Once in the database, I could do things like find the average monthly price for a 2 bedroom flat in an area, and spot bargains through using standard deviation from the mean on the price through using simple SQL queries via phpMyAdmin.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am moving to Manchester soon, and so I thought I&rsquo;d get an idea of the housing market there by scraping all the Manchester Gumtree property adverts into a MySQL database. Once in the database, I could do things like find the average monthly price for a 2 bedroom flat in an area, and spot bargains through using standard deviation from the mean on the price through using simple SQL queries via <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php">phpMyAdmin</a>.</p>
<p>I really like the Python library <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a> for writing scrapers, there is also a Java version called <a href="http://jsoup.org/">JSoup</a>. BeautifulSoup does a really good job of tolerating markup mistakes in the input data, and transforms a page into a tree structure that is easy to work with.</p>
<p>I chose the following layout for the program:</p>
<p><strong>advert.py</strong> - Stores all information about each property advert, with a &lsquo;save&rsquo; method that inserts the data into the mysql database
<strong>listing.py</strong> - Stores all the information on each listing page, which is broken down into links for specific adverts, and also the link to the next listing page in the sequence (ie: the &rsquo;next page&rsquo; link)
<strong>scrapeAdvert.py</strong> - When given an advert URL, this creates and populates an advert object
<strong>scrapeListing.py</strong> - When given a listing URL, this creates and populates a listing object
<strong>scrapeSequence.py</strong> - This walks through a series of listings, calling scrapeListing and scrapeAdvert for all of them, and finishes when there are no more listings in the sequence to scrape</p>
<p>Here is the MySQL table I created for this project (which you will have to setup if you want to run the scraper):</p>

<p>Using BeautifulSoup to pull out elements is quite easy, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ul = self.soup.find(&#39;ul&#39;,attrs={&#34;id&#34; : &#34;ad-details&#34;})
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That finds all the HTML elements under the tag id=&ldquo;ad-details&rdquo;, so all the list elements in that list.

<p>The URL you provide it above gives you the starting page from which to scrape from.</p>
<p>The above code worked well for scraping several hundred Manchester Gumtree ads into a database, from which point I was able to use a combination of phpMyAdmin and OpenOffice Spreadsheet to analyse the data and find out useful statistics about the property market in said area.</p>

<p>Note: Due to the nature of web scraping, if - or more accurately, when - Gumtree changes its user interface, the scraper I have written will need to be tweaked accordingly to find the right data. This is meant to be an informative tutorial, not a finished product.</p>

      <title>RESTful Web Services</title>

      <description>REST (Representational State Transfer) is a way of delivering web services. When a web service conforms to REST, it is known as RESTful. The largest RESTful web service is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) which you use every day to send and receive information from web servers while browsing the internet.
To implement RESTful web services, you should implement four methods: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. Resources on RESTful web services are typically defined as collections of elements.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>REST (Representational State Transfer) is a way of delivering web services. When a web service conforms to REST, it is known as RESTful. The largest RESTful web service is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) which you use every day to send and receive information from web servers while browsing the internet.</p>
<p>To implement RESTful web services, you should implement four methods: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. Resources on RESTful web services are typically defined as collections of elements. The REST methods can either act on a whole collection, or a specific element in a collection.</p>
<p>A collection is usually logically defined as a hierarchy on the URL, for example take this fictitious layout:</p>
<p><strong>Collection:</strong> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/programmes/">www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/programmes/</a>
<strong>Element:</strong> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/programmes/24">www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/programmes/24</a>
<strong>Element:</strong> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/programmes/25">www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/programmes/25</a>
<strong>Element:</strong> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/programmes/26">www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/programmes/26</a></p>
<p>The REST methods you use do different things depending on whether you are interacting with a Collection resource or an Element resource. See below:</p>
<p><strong>On a Collection: ie: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/programmes/">www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/programmes/</a></strong></p>
<p>GET – Lists the URLs of the collection’s members.
PUT – Replace the entire collection with another collection.
POST – Create a new element in a collection, returning the new element’s URL.
DELETE – Deletes the entire collection.</p>
<p><strong>On an Element: ie: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/programmes/24">www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/programmes/24</a></strong></p>
<p>GET – Retrieve the addressed element in the appropriate internet media type, ie: music file or image
PUT – Replace the addressed element of the collection, or if it doesn’t exist, create it in the parent collection.
POST – Treat the addressed element of the collection as a new collection, and add an element into it.
DELETE – Delete the addressed element of the collection.</p>
<p>REST is a simple and clear way of implementing the basic methods of data storage; CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete), see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete</a></p>

      <description>The BBC provide 3 day weather RSS feeds for most locations in the UK. I thought it would be interesting to create a web service to turn the weather feed into calendar feed format, so I could have a constantly updated forecast of the next 3 days of weather mapped on to my iPhone’s calendar. Here it is on my iPhone:
Overview
The service is separated into five files:
ical.php – this contains the class ical which corresponds to a single calendar feed.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BBC provide 3 day weather RSS feeds for most locations in the UK. I thought it would be interesting to create a web service to turn the weather feed into calendar feed format, so I could have a constantly updated forecast of the next 3 days of weather mapped on to my iPhone’s calendar. Here it is on my iPhone:</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>The service is separated into five files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ical.php</strong> – this contains the class ical which corresponds to a single calendar feed. A method called ‘addevent’ allows you to add new events to the calendar, and a method called ‘returncal’ redirects the resulting calendar file to the browser so people can subscribe to it using their calendar application.</li>
<li><strong>forecast.php</strong> – this file contains the class forecast, which has properties for all aspects that we want to record for each day’s forecast, ie: Wind Speed and Humidity. It also contains the forecast set, which is a collection of forecast objects. The set class is serializable, which means each forecast object can be stored in a text file, including the Wind Speed, Humidity and all other things we want to record for each day.</li>
<li><strong>scrape-weather.php</strong> – this file contains code that scrapes the weather feed, populates the forecast set with all the weather information for the next 3 days, and stores the result in a file called forecasts.ser.</li>
<li><strong>forecasts.ser</strong> – this is all the data for the three day weather forecast, in serialized format. It is automatically deleted and recreated when the scrape-weather.php script is run.</li>
<li><strong>reader.php</strong> – this file converts the forecasts.ser file into an iCal calendar, and outputs the iCal formatted result to the calendar application that accesses reader.php page.</li>
</ul>
<p>It uses two external libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MagpieRSS 0.72</strong> – this popular library is used for reading the calendar RSS feed and converting it into a PHP object that is easier to manipulate by scrape-weather.php.</li>
<li><strong>iCalcreator 2.8</strong> – this is used for creating the output iCal format of the calendar in ical.php and outputting it to the browser in reader.php.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Files</strong></p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>SVN Version</strong></p>
<p>If you have subversion, you can check out the project from: <a href="http://svn.davidcraddock.net/weather-services/">http://svn.davidcraddock.net/weather-services/</a>. There are a couple extra files in that directory for my automated freezing weather alerts, but you can safely ignore those.</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>You will have to add this entry to your crontab to run once per day. You could set the script to run at midnight through adding the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>0 0 * * *
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For example, in my case:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/php /home/david_craddock/work.davidcraddock.net/weather/scrape-weather.php
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You will then need to edit the contents of the $store_path and $feed_url variables in scrape-weather.php. Store_path should refer to a file path that the web server can create and edit files in, and feed_url should refer to the RSS feed of your local area that you have copied and pasted from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/">http://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/</a> site, don&rsquo;t use mine because your area is likely different. After that, you&rsquo;re set to go.</p>

      <description>To quickly find large files to delete if you have filled your startup disk, enter this command on the OSX terminal:
sudo find / -size +500000 -print This will find and print out file paths to files over 500MB. You can then go through them and delete them individually by typing rm &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;, although there is no undelete so make sure you know you won&amp;rsquo;t miss them.</description>

      <description>You use the &amp;rsquo;touch&amp;rsquo; command to create two blank files, with a last modified date that you specify - one with a date of the start of the range you want to specify, and the second with a date at the end of the range you want to specify.

      <description>I wrote an email alerter that sends me an email whenever the upcoming temperature may dip below freezing. It uses the Magpie RSS reader to pull down a 3 day weather forecast that is provided for my area in RSS form by the BBC weather site. It then parses this forecast and determines if either today&amp;rsquo;s or tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s weather may dip below freezing. If it might, it sends an email to my email address to warn me.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve committed some code into to CVS, and made a mistake on that commit, you will want to know how to revert to a previously saved version. Here is the command line command for CLI versions of CVS:
$ cvs update -D &amp;#39;1 week ago&amp;#39; Run this command in the main directory of your checked out working copy. This will revert your working copy to the version of the code that was checked in &amp;lsquo;1 week ago&amp;rsquo; from the present date.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing some simple Java GUI applications using the Netbeans IDE. It allows you to quickly make event-driven GUI applications, and generates a lot of skeleton code that you&amp;rsquo;ll need, but don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to type out. It reminds me of the IDE designer of Visual Basic 6, which allowed you to mock up simple GUIs with code in almost no time at all, although the VB language itself often proved difficult.</description>

      <description>Here is some python code I adapted from this stackoverflow post to get the first day of a week specificed by a week number. This method includes leap year and summer time differences.
import time def weeknum(num,year): instr = str(year)+&amp;#34; &amp;#34;+str(num-1)+&amp;#34; 1&amp;#34; print time.asctime(time.strptime(instr,&amp;#39;%Y %W %w&amp;#39;)) Here is me exectuting the code in Python&amp;rsquo;s IDLE shell:
See that the first week of 2009 actually started in 2008, but by the end of that week we are in 2009.</description>

      <description>This is just a quick note to remind myself how I did this.
Hypercam2 is a good, free, video recorder that can cope with recording game videos. It&amp;rsquo;s freely available from http://www.hyperionics.com/hc/downloads.asp - just make sure when you install it you don&amp;rsquo;t tick on the spyware toolbar installation options.
My motherboard has a 5.1 digital soundcard built in. However the only way I can record off the soundcard is to plug in a standard audio cable from the speaker out (green) to the microphone in (orange).</description>

<p>My motherboard has a 5.1 digital soundcard built in. However the only way I can record off the soundcard is to plug in a standard audio cable from the speaker out (green) to the microphone in (orange).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The soundcard switches off the headphone output when it detects a speaker attached to the speaker out, so you have to go to the recording options in Windows 7 and right click on the microphone in. It will give you an option to &lsquo;Monitor this input using the headphones&rsquo; - which will allow you to listen to anything coming into the microphone socket through the headphone socket on the front on my PC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In hypercam, set the sound to record from the default input device, set the frame rate to 10/10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record using the &lsquo;select window to record from&rsquo; option, select the game window, and use the F2 button to start and stop the recording.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The video will be output in AVI format, but you can transcode or convert it into a quicktime MOV file for editing in iMovie, or you can use windows movie editor, which is free and quite good.</p>

      <title>Insights into a modern Indie Music label</title>

      <description>I read this remarkable post on a public mailing list I subscribe to. I thought it was such a great insight into running a music label, that I just had to post it here. It discusses issues facing modern music, such as DRM, DMCA, and other ways of making (or losing) money. Fascinating.
Here it is:
I work for a (fairly small) indie label - from witnessing this model in action I feel I have to stick up for the label given that I see the model working (or sometimes not so well) on a daily basis!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read this remarkable post on a public mailing list I subscribe to. I thought it was such a great insight into running a music label, that I just had to post it here. It discusses issues facing modern music, such as DRM, DMCA, and other ways of making (or losing) money. Fascinating.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p>I work for a (fairly small) indie label - from witnessing this model in action I feel I have to stick up for the label given that I see the model working (or sometimes not so well) on a daily basis! Where we&rsquo;ve done deals with artists in the past, they&rsquo;ve almost always been a 50/50 arrangement - the artist receives 50% of net royalties. Where a label fronts recording costs, these can easily become £6-10,000 for an album session. Even an EP session can be upwards of £1,500 although these figures are a little pessimistic (though not unrealistic). (We actually designed, built and owned studios for ten years until 2001 but the project haemorrhaged money.)</p>
<p>With regards to CD pressing, a 1,000 run will cost around £800 including full colour print in a basic jewel case. The AP1/AP2a MCPS licence costs another amount on top. When getting your CDs pressed, add in other things (Super Jewel cases, slip / O-cards, digipaks or gatefolds with high quality card / fancy posters) and you can easily top the 1k mark, not even counting the artwork design costs. Of course, discount comes with with bulk, but almost nobody except the Big Four do &gt;1k discs in a pressing. (To put things in perspective: when SyCo have done the X Factor Finalists CDs, they press up &gt;10,000 of EACH finalist&rsquo;s recording of the song - and shred the losers&rsquo; copies when the winner is announced!)</p>
<p>To put stuff into distro with someone like Universal, you have your line costs simply to have the title listed on their system - monthly recurring, per title - then handling costs, despatch costs, &ldquo;salesforce&rdquo; costs (even though really the only people they sell into are HMV now, and from last year they&rsquo;ve stopped guaranteeing racking in all but the top 6 or so stores in the UK, it&rsquo;s a joke). You can&rsquo;t sell your discs through at full retail, you have your wholesale (Dealer) price. We&rsquo;ve sold albums through at £6.65 and I&rsquo;ve later seen them in a London HMV for £12.99. Oh, and did I mention that supermarkets and stores like HMV *DEMAND* what they call a &ldquo;file discount&rdquo; of up to 40% just to take stock? (which is on a non-negotiable sale or return basis with up to a six month returns period.)</p>
<p>If you end up in a position where you don&rsquo;t sell stock through into shops, it usually costs less for your distro to SHRED your discs than it does to send it back to you! Ridiculous. The costs are stacked against the labels at all points - incredibly frustrating. And that&rsquo;s even before you begin to contemplate any plugging, promo, advertising, miscellaneous online, merch, booking agent / gig costs&hellip; Or even an advance for the artist! But it gets better&hellip;</p>
<p>So, this figure of 63% which the old techdirt article might quote as truth where valid for major labels (who might also own distribution, management, publishing and studios under the same roof), the model quickly falls apart as soon as focus on a smaller label. I used to think the whole model was bullshit and the artists got shafted, but if anything it&rsquo;s level pegging - smaller labels have just as tough a time as artists as the risk to them to fund any new release is proportionally WAY larger. Also, the techdirt article works on the basis of the artist receiving a 20% royalty - this is dismal, and the artist should be smacked for agreeing to such a pitiful rate like the chumps they probably (hypothetically) are.</p>
<p>Take one of our real world iTunes scenarios - from a 79p purchase, iTunes immediately keeps about 32p. For UK and most worldwide sales, this also includes the royalties which the label&rsquo;s obliged to pay (in the UK, to the MCPS-PRS Alliance). However, the USA requires the selling party to pay the mechanical on each sale (an arse-about-tit form which has arisen from the disconnected Collection Agencies - Harry Fox Agency being the incumbent on Mechanicals and ASCAP, BMI and SESAC on the Performance royalties - which adds yet another level of complication.</p>
<p>From what&rsquo;s left (47p), you halve the resulting amount on a 50/50 deal. Neither the label nor the artist gets much for their work. On some artists whom we&rsquo;ve purely done digital distribution for (on a rolling licence agreement), we give the artist 80% of net. As you can imagine, we get virtually nothing - and our income&rsquo;s directly tied to their success, so we have an interest in seeing them do well. It&rsquo;s a tough environment to be in.</p>
<p>For receiving US/Canadian/Mexico/European/Australasian payments, we first have to receive the currency and have the bank convert it to GBP. Of course, we can&rsquo;t get the Interbank rates, nobody but the banks get those - so more money&rsquo;s immediately lost in conversion. The larger labels will have sweetheart deals with their banks (or almost certainly have accounts in each relevant territory) so this isn&rsquo;t so much of a big deal, but the amount of administration just scales inordinately. If you deal with managing your artists&rsquo; Publishing rights, you can quickly become LITERALLY swamped in paperwork. The amount of time sucked up by adminning the release of music is extraordinary.</p>
<p>So please nobody think all music labels have it easy&hellip; I have no doubt that the Big Four have royally shafted artists in the past but they can largely lumber along based on a few artists doing exceptionally well for the rest of their current roster (with their back catalogue from very famous artists helping too). The problem they&rsquo;re going to have is that almost none of the artists whose catalogue&rsquo;s been released in the past two decades *really* has the staying power of the classic artists - Dire Straits, Genesis, Pink Floyd, The Who or Fleetwood Mac, just to name five off the top of my head. Don&rsquo;t even get me started on the epic fail that is streaming revenues from Spotify, mFlow, We7 etc.</p>
<p>Now even with all of this, I still regard sites like YouTube as a promotional tool. Some of our most famous catalogue I&rsquo;ve held off on issuing DMCA takedowns for, because it&rsquo;s a genuinely beneficial promotional tool - it&rsquo;s the pragmatic response. Where do people go first if they want to quickly listen to a track? YouTube! What happens if they only ever wanted to hear it once and never again? You&rsquo;ve not lost that sale because it almost certainly would never have happened. What happens if they still want to have a copy of that track? They&rsquo;ll go buy it from one of the easily accessible venues, it&rsquo;s not expensive to do. The label&rsquo;s job is to make the catalogue ubiquitous on all of the major (and some of the trendier niche stores) where at all possible. The digital distribution costs are another thing the label has to absorb - monthly, per track, per store usually, if not on an aggregation deal where it&rsquo;s a percentage on each sale but the label usually ends up worse off. It&rsquo;s a tough position because the label almost always feels the need to protect their &lsquo;content&rsquo; (shudder - hate that word) but issuing takedowns for every instance of a track is more often than not a kneejerk reaction which harms longterm sales. I&rsquo;m personally torn between leaving them, taking them down or even putting up better mashup/promo mix versions on the label&rsquo;s official account!</p>
<p>Treat your customers like adults and I think you earn their respect a bit more. This applies to all forms of digital media, including tellybox shows. (thesis: DRM = genuinely unhelpful towards nurturing that unique supportive viewer-provider relationship. Trust your customers, they&rsquo;ll not disrespect you.) In music, nobody wants to buy a track if they can never audition it, and 30sec samples aren&rsquo;t really a good enough.</p>

      <description>I installed Windows 7 after I had installed Ubuntu 10.4. Windows 7 overwrote the Linux bootloader &amp;ldquo;grub&amp;rdquo; on my master boot record. Therefore I had to restore it.
I used the Ubuntu 10.4 LiveCD to start up a live version of Ubuntu. While under the LiveCD, I then restored the Grub bootloader by chrooting into my old install, using the linux command line. This is a fairly complex thing to do, and so I recommend you use this approach only if you&amp;rsquo;re are confident with the linux command line:</description>

      <title>Windows 7 Gaming on my Macbook</title>

      <description>I have a 2006/2007 Core 2 Duo 2.6ghz white macbook, that I use regularly for internet, music, watching films, itunes and integration with my iPhone.
I wanted to turn my desktop PC into a &amp;lsquo;work only&amp;rsquo; Ubuntu Linux machine, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t get distracted when I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be doing something else.
But I still have a lot of PC games that I wanted to play on the Macbook, so I decided to try and setup a windows environment to play games on using Bootcamp 2.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a 2006/2007 Core 2 Duo 2.6ghz white macbook, that I use regularly for internet, music, watching films, itunes and integration with my iPhone.</p>
<p>I wanted to turn my desktop PC into a &lsquo;work only&rsquo; Ubuntu Linux machine, so that I don&rsquo;t get distracted when I&rsquo;m supposed to be doing something else.</p>
<p>But I still have a lot of PC games that I wanted to play on the Macbook, so I decided to try and setup a windows environment to play games on using Bootcamp 2.0 to create a dual-boot OSX/Windows 7 configuration.</p>
<p>It turns out it works really well. The Macbook runs Windows 7 64-bit edition fine, and although the integrated graphics card isn&rsquo;t designed to run modern games very well, you can get a good gaming experience from small indie games and the older type of PC RPGs that I tend to play. My macbook got a 3.5 rating on the windows experience index for graphics, which is sufficient for many PC games.</p>
<p>First you need to partition your macbook&rsquo;s HD using the Bootcamp assistant, in the OSX utilities section. Make sure you have your first OSX installation DVD to hand, the one that came with your Macbook. I chose to split the hard drive into two equally sized partitions. Then just place your W7 DVD in the drive, and Bootcamp takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>Once W7 is installed, you can access the Bootcamp menu on startup by holding down the option key. This brings up a menu where you can select to boot into OSX or Windows.</p>
<p>When you start W7 for the first time, you can install the windows driver set for your Macbook that Bootcamp provides you. Insert your OSX installation DVD 1, and run the setup.exe that is located in the Bootcamp folder. This will install native windows drivers for your Macbook hardware.</p>
<p>The only change I needed to make for my macbook, was to install the latest 64bit Realtek drivers for Vista/Windows 7, which are located <a href="http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsCheck.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=24&amp;PFid=24&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false">on the Realtek website</a>. This will fix any sound problems you might have while playing games.</p>
<p>Now don&rsquo;t expect to run the latest 3D games, but if you&rsquo;re happy enough with slightly older, classic, indie or retro games, you can get a good gaming experience on Windows 7 from your macbook. It does well with plenty of the indie games available on Value&rsquo;s Steam distribution network.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently watching Persepolis, the 2008 animated film about a tomboy anarchist growing up in Iran. I&amp;rsquo;m watching this on my new iPhone 3GS, and the picture and audio quality is very good.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what I used to convert my newly bought Persepolis DVD, for watching on the iPhone.
1x Macbook (but you can use any intel mac) 1x iTunes 1x RipIt - Commercial Mac DVD Ripper (rips up to 10 DVDs on the free trial, $20 after) 1x Handbrake 32 - Freely available transcoder 1x VLC 32 - Freely available media player 1x DVD</description>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I used to convert my newly bought Persepolis DVD, for watching on the iPhone.</p>
<p>1x Macbook (but you can use any intel mac)
1x iTunes
1x RipIt - Commercial Mac DVD Ripper (rips up to 10 DVDs on the free trial, $20 after)
1x Handbrake 32 - Freely available transcoder
1x VLC 32 - Freely available media player
1x DVD</p>
<p>\* Ripit - rips the video and audio from the DVD, onto your computer
\* Handbrake 32 - &rsquo;transcodes&rsquo; the ripped video and audio, meaning - it converts it into an iPhone compatible video file.
\* VLC 32 - is used by Handbrake 32 to get past any problems with converting the media.</p>
<p>Go to the following sites to fetch the software:</p>
<p>1. Ripit - <a href="http://thelittleappfactory.com/ripit/">http://thelittleappfactory.com/ripit/</a>
2. Handbrake 32 - <a href="http://handbrake.fr/downloads.php">http://handbrake.fr/downloads.php</a> (get the 32 bit version)
3. VLC 32 - <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html</a> (be sure to get the 32 bit version)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s currently a difficulty in getting the VLC 64 bit software for the Mac, and so although the 64 bit version is faster to use, you&rsquo;re probably better off with 32 bit versions of both for now.</p>
<p>The Process</p>
<ol>
<li>Rip the DVD.</li>
</ol>
<p>Start RipIt. It will ask for a DVD, insert the DVD.. and point the resultant save location to the desktop. The ripping process takes about 40 minutes on my Macbook, you can check the progress by looking at the icon in the dock - it will be updated with the percentage of progress until completion. You can do other things on your mac while it&rsquo;s ripping, even though the DVD drive will be occupied. Wait until it&rsquo;s completed before continuing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Transcode (convert) the ripped video file for use on the iPhone.</li>
</ol>
<p>Start Handbrake. There are a bunch of transcoding settings called presets - those tell Handbrake what type of media player you want the converted video to work on. In handbrake on the right section of the window, select the iPhone preset. Then go to the file menu, select &lsquo;Open&rsquo;, and then select the video file that RipIt saved onto your desktop. Then select the destination for the converted video file. Then select the Start (green) button on Handbrake window, and it will start. You can now minimise handbrake and do other things. The transcoding process depends on the film, but takes about an hour on my Macbook. You can check on progress by maximizing the Handbrake window, and checking on the progress bar.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Move the converted video file onto your iPhone.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once that&rsquo;s done, you will have another media file on your desktop - this is the end result, a video file that will play on your iPhone. Simply connect your iPhone to your Mac, start up iTunes, and drag that file from your desktop into the iPhone icon on your iTunes window. It will take a couple of minutes to transfer, then eject the iPhone as normal</p>
<p>Now you can watch this new movie on your iPhone by going to the &lsquo;Videos&rsquo; tab of your iPod app.</p>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about making a Flash game or application. Although I haven&amp;rsquo;t made one yet, my current understanding is that most projects of this type require a lot of artwork.
I found this article, and was impressed at the quality and the resources mentioned: http://freelanceflashgames.com/news/2009/03/25/the-big-guide-to-hiring-an-artist/</description>

      <description>This is something that was quite annoying today, as I was struggling to use Wordpress 2.9.2 to align some pictures in the HTML mode of editing a page, on a client&amp;rsquo;s website.
It turns out that Wordpress was adding BR tags sometimes when I hit return.. and sometimes not. The annoying thing was, although the BRs were outputted in the resultant Wordpress site, the BRs were not visible in the Wordpress HTML edit mode itself.</description>

<p>It turns out that Wordpress was adding BR tags sometimes when I hit return.. and sometimes not. The annoying thing was, although the BRs were outputted in the resultant Wordpress site, the BRs were not visible in the Wordpress HTML edit mode itself.. meaning they were invisible and undetectable until I viewed the resultant website source and finally figured it out.</p>
<p>Wordpress does insert some formatting tags now and then, it seems, but I would have thought it would tell you about the tags that would change the page layout! Apparently not. Anyway, something to be aware of for Wordpress gurus..</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time to report this as a bug, but this is the stack I&rsquo;m using for anyone interested:</p>
<p>Browser: Google Chrome for Mac (5.0.342.9 beta)
TinyMCE Advanced Editor Plugin for WP (3.2.7)
Wordpress 2.9.2</p>
<p>The beta of Google Chrome is a bit unstable, although it may not be the source of the problem.</p>

      <title>Forkbombs and How to Prevent Them</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2010/04/02/forkbombs-and-how-to-prevent-them/</link>

      <description>A forkbomb is a program or script that continually creates new copies of itself, that create new copies of themselves. It&amp;rsquo;s usually a function that calls itself, and each time that function is called, it creates a new process to run the same function.
You end up with thousands of processes, all creating processes themselves, with an exponential growth. Soon it takes up all the resources of your server, and prevents anything else running on it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A forkbomb is a program or script that continually creates new copies of itself, that create new copies of themselves. It&rsquo;s usually a function that calls itself, and each time that function is called, it creates a new process to run the same function.</p>
<p>You end up with thousands of processes, all creating processes themselves, with an exponential growth. Soon it takes up all the resources of your server, and prevents anything else running on it.</p>
<p>Forkbombs are an example of a denial of service attack, because it completely locks up the server it&rsquo;s run on.</p>
<p>More worryingly, on a lot of Linux distributions, you can run a forkbomb as any user that has an account on that server. So for example, if you give your friend an account on your server, he can crash it/lock it up whenever he wants to, with the following shell script forkbomb:</p>
<p><code>:(){ :|:&amp; };: </code></p>
<p>Bad, huh?</p>
<p>Ubuntu server 9.10 is vulnerable to this shell script forkbomb. Run it on your linux server as any user, and it will lock it up.</p>
<p>This is something I wanted to fix right away on all my linux servers. Linux is meant to be multiuser, and it has a secure and structured permissions system allowing dozens of users to log in and do their work, at the same time. However when any one user can lock up the entire server, this is not good for a multiuser environment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, fixing this on ubuntu server 9.10 is quite simple. You limit the maximum number of running processes that any user can create. So the fork bomb runs, but hits this ceiling, and eventually stops without the administrator having to do anything.</p>
<p>As root, edit this file, and add the following line:</p>
<p>/etc/security/limits.conf</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>...
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>...
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>*               soft    nproc   35
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This sets the maximum process cap for all users, to be 35. The root user isn&rsquo;t affected by this limit. This limit of 35 should be fine for remote servers that are not offering users gnome, kde, or any other graphical X interface. If you are expecting your users to be able to run applications like that, you may want to increase the limit to 50, and although this will increase the time forkbombs will take to exit, they should still exit without locking up your server.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can setup an &lsquo;untrusted&rsquo; and &rsquo;trusted&rsquo; user groups, and assign that 35 limit to the untrusted users, giving trusted users access to the trusted group, which does not have that limit. Use these lines:</p>
<p>/etc/security/limits.conf</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>...
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>...
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>@untrusted               soft    nproc   35
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>@trusted               soft    nproc   50
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I&rsquo;ve tested these nproc limits on 8.10 and 9.10 ubuntu-server installs, but you should really test your own servers install, if possible, by forkbombing it yourself as a standard user, using the bash forkbomb above, once you&rsquo;ve applied the fix. The fix is effective as soon as you&rsquo;ve edited that file, but please note that you have to logout, and log back in again as a standard user before the new process cap is applied to your user account.</p>

      <title>How to remove nano, vim and other editors&#39; backup files out of a directory tree</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2010/03/22/how-to-remove-nano-vim-and-other-editors-backup-files-out-of-a-directory-tree/</link>

      <description>Linux command-line editors such as nano and vim often, by default, create backup files with the prefix of &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;. I.e, if I created a file called /home/david/myfile, then nano would create a backup in /home/david/myfile. Sometimes it doesn&amp;rsquo;t delete them either, so you&amp;rsquo;re left with a bunch of backup files all over the place, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re editing a lot on a directory tree full of source code.
Those stray backup files make directory listings confusing, and also add unnecessary weight to the commits on source control systems such as svn, cvs, git.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Linux command-line editors such as nano and vim often, by default, create backup files with the prefix of &ldquo;<del>&rdquo;. I.e, if I created a file called /home/david/myfile, then nano would create a backup in /home/david/myfile</del>. Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t delete them either, so you&rsquo;re left with a bunch of backup files all over the place, especially if you&rsquo;re editing a lot on a directory tree full of source code.</p>
<p>Those stray backup files make directory listings confusing, and also add unnecessary weight to the commits on source control systems such as svn, cvs, git.. etc. If you&rsquo;re working on a programming team with other people, then it causes further problems and confusion, because person A&rsquo;s editor can accidentally load person B&rsquo;s backup file.. etc etc. Nightmare.</p>
<p>So instruct your editor, or the programming team you&rsquo;re working with, not to drop these backup files. You can configure most editors to change the place where the editor drops its backup files, so you could store all your backup files in a subdirectory of your home directory, for example, if needed. However I always set my editors not to leave backup files about.</p>
<p>Once you know that new backup files will not be created, view the current list of backup files, along with the user that created them.. so you know who&rsquo;s been creating the backup files and when, etc:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>find . -name &#39;*~&#39; -type f -exec ls -al {}  ;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then archive the stray backup files, with this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>find . -name &#39;*~&#39; -type f -exec mv -i {} ./archived-backups ;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That will find all backup files in the current directory and below, and move them all to a subdirectory in the current directory called &lsquo;archived-backups&rsquo;. This is a fairly safe find/exec command, because with the -i switch, mv will not &lsquo;clobber&rsquo;. This means If you have two backup files, one in /opt/code/index~ and one in /opt/code/bla/bla/index~, they will not &lsquo;clobber&rsquo;, or overwrite each other automatically when moved into the new directory. You will be informed of any conflicts present so you can resolve them yourself.</p>
<p>However in practice I usually omit the &lsquo;-i&rsquo; switch and let them clobber each other, because I usually end up deleting the ./archived-backups/ directory very quickly after that anyway.</p>

      <title>Tip for watching the completion of a large file copy</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2010/03/20/tip-for-watching-the-completion-of-a-large-file-copy/</link>

      <description>Forget the wonderful windows progress bar, and imagine I&amp;rsquo;m in the world of command-line Linux, and I want to copy a 484MB file, called VMware-server-2.0.2-203138.i386.tar.gz, from my home directory to a remote server. But I want to figure out how long it&amp;rsquo;s going to take.
1. First I can run a &amp;ldquo;du -m&amp;rdquo; command to get the total MB size of the original file:
du -m /home/david/VMware-server-2.0.2-203138.i386.tar.gz I.e: david@believe:~$ du -m VMware-server-2.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/windows-copy.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/windows-copy.gif" type="" alt=""  /></a></p>
<p>Forget the wonderful windows progress bar, and imagine I&rsquo;m in the world of command-line Linux, and I want to copy a 484MB file, called VMware-server-2.0.2-203138.i386.tar.gz, from my home directory to a remote server. But I want to figure out how long it&rsquo;s going to take.</p>
<p>1. First I can run a &ldquo;du -m&rdquo; command to get the total MB size of the original file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>du -m /home/david/VMware-server-2.0.2-203138.i386.tar.gz
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I.e:
<code>david@believe:~$ du -m VMware-server-2.0.2-203138.i386.tar.gz 484     VMware-server-2.0.2-203138.i386.tar.gz</code></p>
<p>Now I know it is approximately 484MB.</p>
<p>2. Then I run the copy. I&rsquo;m copying the file from /home/david/ to /opt/remote/myserver, which is a remotely mounted directory on a server somewhere in Canada.</p>
<p><code>david@believe:~$ cp ./VMware-server-2.0.2-203138.i386.tar.gz /opt/remote/myserver/</code></p>
<p>At this point cp will just hang until it&rsquo;s finished. There is normally no progress indicator or anything. But I want to figure out how much of the file has been copied, so I can figure out how much is left to copy, and get a rough idea of the progress.</p>
<p>3. So I SSH into the remote server in Canada, and run this command</p>
<p><code>david@myserver:~$ watch du -m ./VMware-server-2.0.2-203138.i386.tar.gz</code></p>
<p>the copy command by default seems to be incremental, ie: piece by piece, not all at once. Therefore with the &ldquo;Watch&rdquo; command, you can watch the size, in MB, of the new file as it accumulates. The watch command will refresh every 2 seconds, so you&rsquo;ll be updated as the copy goes on.</p>
<p>You can probably invoke a progress meter with the cp command, or use rsync. Rsync is much better for large file copies, and remote file copies. But the advantage of the method above is that you can watch file copies already executed without any special arguments, which I sometimes find very useful when I remember that that file I already started copying isn&rsquo;t 200MB.. it&rsquo;s actually 2.5GB.</p>

      <title>The Linux Root Directory, Explained</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s helpful to know the basic filesystem on a Linux machine, to better understand where everything is supposed to go, and where you should start looking if you want to find a certain file.
Everything in Linux is stored in the &amp;ldquo;root directory&amp;rdquo;. On a windows machine, that would be equivalent to C:. C: is the main folder where everything is stored. On Linux we call this the &amp;ldquo;root directory&amp;rdquo;, or simply &amp;ldquo;/&amp;rdquo;.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/got-root.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/got-root.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></a> It&rsquo;s helpful to know the basic filesystem on a Linux machine, to better understand where everything is supposed to go, and where you should start looking if you want to find a certain file.</p>

<p>Above you can see the files and folders in the root directory of my ubuntu linux server, after I&rsquo;ve typed &rsquo;ls /&rsquo;. Ignore everything but the coloured names on the right, those coloured names are the names of the files and folders in this directory. Don&rsquo;t worry about the shades of different colours either. It&rsquo;s not really important to explain how they are coloured right now, just to explain the purpose behind each file or folder shown.</p>
<p>So let me explain the purpose behind each of these, in turn. I&rsquo;ll include the same screenshot multiple times, so you can reference the explanations against it as you scroll down.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>- This is a catch-all directory for &lsquo;variables&rsquo;, ie things that the OS has to write to, and vary, as part of its operation. Examples include: email inboxes for all users, cache files, the lock files that are generated and removed as part of normal program execution, and also the /var/www directory. /var/www is a directory you will probably see and use a lot, as it is where all the websites are stored that your linux machine serves when operating as a web server. /var/log is also a very important directory, and contains &rsquo;log&rsquo; files which is a kind of &ldquo;diary&rdquo; that the linux OS uses to explain exactly what it&rsquo;s done, as it happens, so you can easily find out what&rsquo;s been going on by viewing the right log file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>tmp/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>- The space for any and all temporary files. Store files here that you want to throw away quite quickly. Depending on your configuration, all files and folders in the /tmp directory may be deleted on system reboot, or more frequently, perhaps every day.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>root/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>- This is the system administrators &lsquo;my documents&rsquo; folder. Anything that the sysadmin stores, for example: programs that he downloads, are put here. Not accessible to anyone else but the system administrator.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>- Configuration files. Any and all program configuration files or information belong here. Think of it like the windows registry, except every registry entry is a text file that you can open up and edit, and also copy, move around, and save. You will typically have to create configuration files yourself sometimes, and put them in this directory. They are almost always simple text files.</p>

      <description>I wrote this list to remind me, as a newcomer to OSX, how the command line differed from the Linux commandline. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d expand on it, and share it:
To mount any iso:
hdiutil mount sample.iso To download a file as you would using wget:
curl http://ftp.heanet.ie/pub/linuxmint.com/stable/8/LinuxMint-8.iso -o linuxmint.iso -C - the -o specifies the output file (required) the -C - specifies automatically resuming if possible.
To burn a bootable iso to CD, DVD or USB key: use the &amp;ldquo;diskutil&amp;rdquo; program as described in: http://forums.</description>

      <title>Long Bash History Files are Great.</title>

      <description>When I&amp;rsquo;m installing software, or doing some complicated stuff on the linux command line, which nowadays is pretty much all the time, I will sometimes want to remember exactly what I typed.
Now the normal /home/david/.bash_history file is usually fine for that. Run this command, for example, and you will see the commands you typed in before you logged out of the server last time you used it:
cat ~/.bash_history You can also find out what you typed in this session, ie: since you logged in, by typing this:</description>

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>cat ~/.bash_history
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can also find out what you typed in this session, ie: since you logged in, by typing this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>history
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is great, and it&rsquo;s even more useful if you add a grep pipeline, so you can search through the previous commands you typed in for a particular phrase or command, ie:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>history | grep apt-get
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However what I really want nowadays is an almost infinite bash_history file, so I can find out not just what I did last week, but two weeks ago, or last month or perhaps last year. Now there are obvious security risks involved with this, and to make sure you don&rsquo;t accidently store mistyped passwords to other systems, or other things, you should probably make sure you never type them in on the command line. This is good practice anyway, and since I use key&rsquo;d sshd logins exclusively nowadays, there is not much chance of me tripping up, typing a password into the terminal, and then forgetting about it. In theory however, using long/infinite bash_history files does mean that if anyone compromised your shell account, they&rsquo;d have any passwords to systems that you mistyped.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m careful with this. You can also clear your history file quite quickly if you do accidently find you&rsquo;ve messed up. Log out, log back in again, and just do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>echo  &gt; ~/.bash_history
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then that will delete all the previous logged commands.</p>
<p>Apart from serving as a major memory aid to complicated install work, and a log for those increasingly complicated chained, piped, one-liners that I&rsquo;m fond of but only really want to have to type once, there are other benefits to keeping a large bash_history file. The main one is that it makes it easy to convert your previous commands into a handy shell script or two, which you can set to run at a specific time of day via cron.. or even make into a system-wide command for other users to use.</p>
<p>OK so hopefully I&rsquo;ve convinced you that it can be very useful to have a long, persistent, bash_history file. But how do you configure the shell so that it does this for you? The following is the magic customization lines that I use on my personal desktops, laptops, and any other trusted computers that I think are reasonably free from the risk of people hacking in just to retrieve my .bash_history file..:</p>
<p>/home/david/bash_profile
`..
..</p>
<h2 id="bash-history-db">bash history db</h2>
<h1 id="heading"></h1>
<h1 id="increase-the-history-file-size-to-20000-lines">increase the history file size to 20,000 lines</h1>
<p>export HISTSIZE=20000</p>
<h1 id="append-all-commands-to-the-history-file-dont-overwrite-it-at-the-start-of-every-new-session">append all commands to the history file, don&rsquo;t overwrite it at the start of every new session</h1>
<p>shopt -s histappend
`</p>
<p>The above will give you an (almost) infinite bash_history file. It will start deleting old commands at 20,000 lines, ie: 20,000 commands. Make sure you have enough disk space for that. My .bash_history file is currently at around 200KB, not a huge file by any means. I&rsquo;d say it will grow to 400-600KB max. If you want to calculate approximatly how much it will use, then in bytes, it&rsquo;s the number of characters in your average linux command x 20,000.</p>

      <title>My minimal VIM config</title>

      <description>This is the absolute minimum I do when I have to log onto a new server or shell account that I haven&amp;rsquo;t used before, that I will need to edit text files with.
First I figure out whether VIM is really installed. A lot of installs, especially those based on ubuntu, ship with VI aliased to VIM, but the VIM install is usually not really VIM at all, and behaves exactly like VI but with some minor bugs fixed.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the absolute minimum I do when I have to log onto a new server or shell account that I haven&rsquo;t used before, that I will need to edit text files with.</p>
<p>First I figure out whether VIM is really installed. A lot of installs, especially those based on ubuntu, ship with VI aliased to VIM, but the VIM install is usually not really VIM at all, and behaves exactly like VI but with some minor bugs fixed. This is not what I want.</p>
<p>So first I figure out what distribution of linux I&rsquo;m using through executing the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>cat /etc/issue
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then if it&rsquo;s ubuntu, which doesn&rsquo;t ship with the full VIM package on a lot of default installs, then I usually do this, presuming I have admin access. In practice I usually have admin access because people are generous with this when they want you to fix their server =) Anyway, if I have admin access, I install ubuntu&rsquo;s &lsquo;vim full&rsquo; package, which is aliased as &lsquo;vim&rsquo;:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo apt-get install vim
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now I can move onto my config. Occasionally there will be a global system config, but I probably want to override that anyway. So I create a vim configuration file specific to me in my home directory:</p>
<p>/home/david/.vimrc
<code>set bg=dark set backspace=2 </code></p>
<p>The first line sets the background to be dark, so I can see what is going on when I use a dark terminal program, such as putty, mac osx&rsquo;s terminal.. in fact nearly all terminal programs use a dark background, so this setting is almost compulsory.</p>
<p>The second line configures the behaviour of the backspace key, so when I go the the start of a line, and press backspace, it adopts the wordprocessor conventional behaviour of skipping to the above line. Otherwise it uses the default VI behaviour, which is probably not intuitive at all to anyone who didn&rsquo;t grow up on UNIX mainframes and such.</p>
<p>The very existence of a user-supplied configuration file will also jolt the VIM editor into &rsquo;non compatible mode&rsquo;, where it figures out automatically that it should be doing all the advanced VIM things, instead of just acting as a VI replacement. This should mean that if you create a config file, syntax highlighting is already turned on, another must for me. Otherwise you can explicitly set it with the line &lsquo;syntax on&rsquo;, but I never have to do this anymore.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>

      <title>Using the Linux command &#39;Watch&#39; to test Cron jobs and more</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net/2010/03/13/using-the-linux-command-watch-to-test-cron-jobs/</link>

      <description>OK, so you have added a cron job that you want to perform a routine task every day at 6am. How do you test it?
You probably don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend all night waiting for it to execute, and there&amp;rsquo;s every chance that when it does execute, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to find out whether it is executing properly - the task might take 30 minutes to run, for example. So every time you debug it and want to test it again, you have to wait until 6am the following day.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, so you have added a cron job that you want to perform a routine task every day at 6am. How do you test it?</p>
<p>You probably don&rsquo;t want to spend all night waiting for it to execute, and there&rsquo;s every chance that when it does execute, you won&rsquo;t be able to find out whether it is executing properly - the task might take 30 minutes to run, for example. So every time you debug it and want to test it again, you have to wait until 6am the following day.</p>
<p>So instead, configure that cron job to run a bit earlier than that, say in 10 minutes, and monitor the execution with a &lsquo;watch&rsquo; command, so you can see if it&rsquo;s doing what you want it to.</p>
<p>&lsquo;watch&rsquo; is a great command that will run a command at frequent intervals, by default, every 2 seconds. It&rsquo;s very useful when chained with the &lsquo;ps&rsquo; command, like the following:</p>
<p><code>watch 'ps aux | grep bash'</code></p>
<p>What that command will do, is continually monitor your server, and maintain an updated list that changes every 2 seconds, of every instance of the bash shell. When someone logs in and spawns a new bash shell, you&rsquo;ll know about it. When a cron&rsquo;d command runs that invokes a bash shell before executing a shellscript, you&rsquo;ll know about it. When someone writes a badly written shell script, and runs it invoking about 100 bash shells by accident, flooding your servers memory, you&rsquo;ll know about it.</p>
<p>OK so back to the cron example. Suppose I&rsquo;m testing a cronjob that should invoke a shell script that runs an rsync command. I just set the cron job to run in 5 minutes, then run this command:</p>
<p><code>watch 'ps aux | grep rsync'</code></p>
<p>Here is the result.. every single rsync command that is running on my server is displayed, and the list is updated every 2 seconds:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Every 2.0s: ps aux | grep rsync                                              Sat Mar 13 15:59:35 2010

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now I can see the time ticking away, and when the cron job is run, I can watch in real-time as it invokes rsync, and I can keep monitoring it to make sure all is running smoothly. This proves to be very useful when troubleshooting cron jobs.</p>
<p>You can also run two commands at the same time. You can actually tail a log file and combine it with the process monitoring like so:</p>
<p><code>watch 'tail /var/log/messages &amp;&amp; ps aux | grep rsync'</code></p>
<p>Try this yourself. It constantly prints out the last ten lines of the standard messages log file every two seconds, while monitoring the number of rsync processes running, and the commands used to invoke them. Tailor it to the cron&rsquo;d job you wish to test.</p>
<p>Watch can be used to keep an eye on other things also. If you&rsquo;re running a multi-user server and you want to see who&rsquo;s logged on at any one time, you can run this command:</p>
<p><code>watch 'echo CURRENT: &amp;&amp; who &amp;&amp; echo LASTLOGIN: &amp;&amp; lastlog | grep -v Never'</code></p>
<p>This chains 5 commands together. It will keep you updated with the current list of users logged in to your system, and it will also give you a constantly updated list of those users who have ever logged in before, with their last login time.</p>
<p>The following shows the output of that command above on a multi-user server I administrate, and will refresh with current information every 2 seconds until I exit it:</p>

Everyone else is logged in remotely. Mike currently has two connections, or sessions, on the server. We can also see the list of users that have logged in before - ie: are active users, and when they last logged on. I immediately notice, for example, that rei hasn&rsquo;t logged in for 4 months and probably isn&rsquo;t using her account.</p>
<p>(Normally this command will also provide IP addresses and hostnames of where the users have logged on from, but I&rsquo;ve replaced those with &lsquo;wherever&rsquo; for privacy reasons)</p>
<p>So.. you can see that the &lsquo;watch&rsquo; command can be a useful window into what is happening, in real-time, on your servers.</p>

      <title>Changing the default &#34;From:&#34; email address for emails sent via PHP on Linux</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had to solve this problem a couple of times at least, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite a common task, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d document it here.
When you send emails to users of your site through using the PHP mail() function, they will sometimes turn up in the mailbox of customers of your site with the following from address:
From: Root &amp;lt;root@apache.ecommercecompany.com&amp;gt; This makes absolutely no sense to your customers, and often they will think it is spam and delete it.</description>

<p>When you send emails to users of your site through using the PHP mail() function, they will sometimes turn up in the mailbox of customers of your site with the following from address:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>From: Root &lt;root@apache.ecommercecompany.com&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This makes absolutely no sense to your customers, and often they will think it is spam and delete it. Often, the decision will be made for them by their web mail host, such as hotmail.com or googlemail.com, and they will never even see the email. You don&rsquo;t want this to happen.</p>
<p>Writing email templates that appear &ldquo;trustworthy&rdquo; and have a low chance of being mislabled as spam by the webmail companies, is quite a difficult task, and there&rsquo;s quite a bit to know about it. However it is quite easy to change the default &ldquo;From:&rdquo; email address that PHP sends your emails on as, and that will definitely help.</p>
<p>Assuming you&rsquo;re running a linux server using sendmail, all you have to do is this.</p>
<p>First create an email address that you would want the customers to see, through editing the /etc/aliases files and running the command newaliases. I created an email address called <strong><a href="mailto:customer-emails@ecommercecompany.com">customer-emails@ecommercecompany.com</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Then change the following sendmail_path line in your php.ini file to something like this:</p>
<p>/etc/php.ini
<code>... sendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i -F 'customer-emails' -f 'Customer Emails &lt;customer-emails@ecommercecompany.com&gt;' ... </code></p>
<p>Broken down, those extra options are:
<code>-F 'customer-emails' # the name of the sender -f 'Customer Emails &lt;customer-emails@ecommercecompany.com&gt;' # the email From header, which should have the name matching the email address, and it should be the same email address as above </code></p>
<p>Then restart apache, and it should load the php.ini file changes. Test it by sending a couple of emails to your email address, and you should see emails sent out like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>From: Customer Emails &lt;customer-emails@ecommercecompany.com&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using these shell scripts I wrote to convert between unix and windows text file formats. They seem to work well without any problems. If you put them in the /usr/sbin/ directory, they will be accessible on the path of the linux admin account root.
/usr/sbin/unix2win `#!/bin/bash

<p>/usr/sbin/unix2win

<p>cat $1 | tr -d &lsquo;15&rsquo; | tee $1 &gt;/dev/null
`</p>
<p>I use these scripts with the combination of find and xargs to convert lots of log files into windows format with the following command. However this type of command can be dangerous, so don&rsquo;t use it if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing:
<code>find sync-logs/ -name '*.log' -type f | xargs -n1 unix2win</code></p>

      <description>Back in 2008, I wrote a PHP class that fetched an arbitary URL, parsed it, and coverted it into an PHP object with different attributes for the different elements of the page. I recently updated it and sent it along to a company that wanted a programming example to show I could code in PHP.
I thought someone may well find a use for it - I&amp;rsquo;ve used the class in several different web scraping applications, and I found it handy.</description>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>/// WHAT IT DOES
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>It uses CURL to pull down a page from a URL, and sorts it into a &#39;Page&#39; object
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>which has different attributes for the different HTML properties of the page
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>structure. By default it will also print the page object&#39;s properties neatly
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>onto the commandline as part of its unit test.

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>* expected-result.txt - output of the unit tests on my development machine
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>* curl-cookie-jar.txt - this file will be created when you run the page.php&#39;s unit test

      <title>Config files for the Windows version of VIM</title>

      <description>Today I encountered problems configuring the windows version of the popular text editor VIM, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write up a quick post talk about configuration files under the Windows version, if anyone becomes stuck like I did. I use Linux, OSX and Windows on a day-to-day basis, and VIM as a text editor for a lot of quick edits on all three platforms. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick comparison:
Linux Linux is easy because that&amp;rsquo;s what most people who use VIM run, and so it is very well tested.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I encountered problems configuring the windows version of the popular text editor <a href="http://www.vim.org">VIM</a>, so I thought I&rsquo;d write up a quick post talk about configuration files under the Windows version, if anyone becomes stuck like I did. I use Linux, OSX and Windows on a day-to-day basis, and VIM as a text editor for a lot of quick edits on all three platforms. Here&rsquo;s a quick comparison:</p>
<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>
<p>Linux is easy because that&rsquo;s what most people who use VIM run, and so it is very well tested.</p>
<p><strong>~/.vimrc</strong> - Configuration file for command line vim.
<strong>~/.gvimrc</strong> - Configuration file for gui vim.</p>
<h3 id="osx">OSX</h3>
<p>OSX is simple also, as it&rsquo;s based on unix:</p>
<p><strong>~/.vimrc</strong> - Configuration file for command line vim.
<strong>~/.gvimrc</strong> - Configuration file for gui vim.</p>
<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
<p>Windows is not easy at all.. it doesn&rsquo;t have a unix file structure, and doesn&rsquo;t have support for the unix hidden file names, that start with a &lsquo;.&rsquo;, ie: &lsquo;.vimrc&rsquo;, &lsquo;.bashrc&rsquo;, and so on. Most open-source programs like VIM that require these hidden configuration files, and have been ported over to windows, seem to adopt this naming convention: &lsquo;_vimrc&rsquo;, &lsquo;_bashrc&rsquo;.. and so forth. So:</p>
<p><strong>_vimrc</strong> - Configuration file for command line vim.
<strong>_gvimrc</strong> - Configuration file for gui vim.</p>
<p>Renaming configuration files from &ldquo;.&rdquo; to &ldquo;_&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t make much difference on its own. You&rsquo;d have to rename your files, but.. big deal. It&rsquo;s not much of a problem.</p>
<p>Another, more tricky, problem you may encounter however, is that there&rsquo;s no clear <strong>home</strong> directory on windows systems. Each major incarnation of windows seems to have a slightly different way of dealing with user&rsquo;s files.. from 2000 to XP, a change, from XP to Vista, there is a change. I haven&rsquo;t tried VIM on W7 yet, but it seems similar to Vista in structure, so this information may actually be consistent to W7.</p>
<p>The Vista 64 version of VIM I have, looks in another place for configuration files. For a global configuration file, it looks in &ldquo;C:Program Files&rdquo;. Yes.. &ldquo;C:Program Files&rdquo;. According to Vista 64&rsquo;s version of VIM.. that&rsquo;s the exact directory where I installed VIM. This is clearly not right. What&rsquo;s happening is that the file system on windows is different to the unix-type file systems, and the VIM port is having problems adapting. The real VIM install directory is <strong>C:Program Filesvim72</strong>. Because VIM is looking for a global configuration file in &ldquo;C:Program Files_vimrc&rdquo;, it&rsquo;ll never find it.</p>
<p>Now you could override this with a batch file that sets the right environmental variables on startup, or you could change the environmental variables exported in windows, but I prefer to have a user-specified configuration file in my personal files directory, as it&rsquo;s easier to backup and manage. If you wanted to specify the environmental variables yourself, which I&rsquo;m guessing many will, the two environmental variables to override are:</p>
<p>$VIM = the VIM install directory, not always set properly, as I mentioned.
$HOME = the logged in user&rsquo;s documents and settings directory, in windows speak this is also where the &lsquo;user profile&rsquo; is stored, which is a collection of settings and configurations for the user. The exact directory will depend on which version of Windows you&rsquo;re running, and if you override the HOME folder, you may have problems with other programs that rely on it being static.</p>
<p>On my Windows Vista 64 install:</p>
<p><strong>$VIM = &ldquo;C:Program Files&rdquo;</strong> <strong>$HOME = &ldquo;C:UsersDave&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>You can see what files VIM includes by running the handy command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>vim -V

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice how it does pull in all the syntax highlighting macros and other extension files correctly, which are specified in the <strong>.vim</strong> files above.. but it doesn&rsquo;t pull in the global configuration files that I&rsquo;ve copied also to <strong>C:Program Filesvim72_gvimrc</strong> and <strong>C:Program Filesvim72_vimrc</strong>. However, it does pickup the files I copied to <strong>C:UsersDave</strong>.. both the <strong>C:UsersDave_vimrc</strong> and <strong>C:UsersDave_gvimrc</strong> are picked up, although VIM will normally read &lsquo;_gvimrc&rsquo; when the gui version of VIM is run (called gvim).</p>
<p>To see exactly what those environmental variables are being set to, when you&rsquo;re inside the editor, issue these two commands, and their values will be show in the editor:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>:echo $HOME
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:echo $VIM
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It seems to make sense for me - and perhaps you, if you&rsquo;re working with VIM on windows - to place my _vimrc and _gvimrc files configuration files in $HOME in Vista. They are then picked up without having to worry about explicitly defining any environmental variables, creating a batch file, or any other hassle.</p>
<p>You can do this easily by the following two commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>:ed $HOME_vimrc
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:sp $HOME_gvimrc
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That will open the two new configuration files, side by side, and you can paste in your existing configuration that you&rsquo;ve used in Linux, and windows will pick them up the next time you start VIM.</p>

      <description>There are more than a gazillion ways to use regexs. I am sure they are each very useful for their own subset of problems. The sheer variety can be highly confusing and scary for a lot of people though, and you only need to use a few approaches to accomplish most text-editing tasks.
Here is a simple method for using regex in the powerful text editor VIM that will work well for common use.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are <a href="http://www.geocities.com/volontir/">more than a gazillion ways</a> to use regexs. I am sure they are each very useful for their own subset of problems. The sheer variety can be highly confusing and scary for <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=regex+difficult">a lot of people</a> though, and you only need to use a few approaches to accomplish most text-editing tasks.</p>
<p>Here is a simple method for using regex in the powerful text editor <a href="http://www.vim.org">VIM</a> that will work well for common use.</p>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<p>We are going to take the &ldquo;search and delete a word&rdquo; problem for an example. We want to delete all instances of the singular noun &ldquo;needle&rdquo; in a text file. Let&rsquo;s assume there are no instances of the pluralisation &ldquo;needles&rdquo; in our document.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Debug on</em></strong>.. turn some VIM options on
<code>:set hlsearch :set wrapscan </code> - this will make all regex expressions possible to debug by visually showing what they match in your document (first line) and make all searches wrap around instead of just search forward from your current position, which is the default. (second line)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Develop and Test</em></strong>.. your regex attempts by using a simple search. Here we see three attempts at solving the problem: <code>:/needl :/needle :/&lt;needle&gt;</code> - our third try is correct, and highlights all words that spell &ldquo;needle&rdquo;. The <strong>&lt;</strong> and <strong>&gt;</strong> markers allow you to specify the beginning and the end of a word. Play with different regexs using the simple search and watching what is highlighted, until you discover one that works for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Run</em></strong>&hellip; your regex <code>:%s/&lt;needle&gt;//g</code> - once you&rsquo;ve figured out a regex, run the regex on your document. This example will execute a search for the word &ldquo;needle&rdquo; and delete every one. If you wanted to substitute needle for another word, you would put the word in between the <strong>/</strong> <strong>/</strong> marks. As we can see, there is nothing between the marks in this example, so it will replace instances of &ldquo;needle&rdquo; with nothing. This means it will serve to delete every instance of the word &ldquo;needle&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Check things are OK</em></strong>&hellip; with your document <code>:/&lt;needle&gt; :/needle :/needl</code> - has the regex done what you want? Use the search function to see if regex has done what you wanted it to do. The above examples show different searches through the document to see if different variations remain. Any matches of these searches will highlight any problems. You can use the lower-case <strong>N</strong>(next search result) and lower-case <strong>P</strong>(previous search result) commands to navigate through any found search results. You must remember to manually look through the document and see what the regex has changed, make sure there aren&rsquo;t any unwanted surprises!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Recover</em></strong>&hellip; from any mistakes <code>u</code> - just press the <strong>U</strong> key (with no capslock or shift). This will undo the very last last change made to the document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Redo</em></strong>&hellip; any work that you need to <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;-r</code> - use the redo fuction; press the <strong>CONTROL</strong> and <strong>R</strong> keys together (with no capslock or shift). This will redo the last change made to the document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Finish up and Write</em></strong>&hellip; to file <code>:w</code> - write your work on the document to file. Even after you have written out to file, you can probably still use the undo function to get back to where you were, but it&rsquo;s best practice to not rely on this, and only write once you&rsquo;re done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Debug off</em></strong>.. turn some options off
<code>:set nohlsearch :set nowrapscan </code> - turn off the regular expression highlighting (line 1). turn off the wraparound searching (line 2). You can leave either or both options on if you want, they&rsquo;re often useful. Up to you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Use a combination of these wonderful commands to test and improve your regex development skills in VIM.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Here I use the shorthand &quot; <strong>#&hellip;</strong>&quot; to denote comments on what I&rsquo;m doing&hellip; if you want to copy and paste the example as written, then you will have to remove those comments.</p>
<p>1. Remove ancient uppercase <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tags from a document.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>:set wrapscan # debug on

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:set nohlsearch # debug off
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:set nowrapscan # debug off
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>2. Oh no! We missed some lower and mixedcase <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tags that some sneaky person slipped in. Let&rsquo;s take them out.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>:set wrapscan # debug on
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:set hlsearch # debug on
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:/&lt;blink&gt; # try 1.. hm.. worked for many, but didnt match BlInK or blINK mixedcase
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:/&lt;blink&gt;/i # try 2.. much better.. seems to have worked!
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:%s/&lt;blink&gt;//i # lets execute my regex remove
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:/BLINK # check 1.. testing things are OK in my file by searching through..
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:/blinked # check 2.. yep thats ok..
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:/&lt;blink&gt; # check 3.. yep thats fine.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:/&lt;blink&gt;/i # check 4.. looks good... problem solved
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span># ...manual scroll through the document.. looks much better!
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:w # write out to file
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:set nohlsearch # debug off
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:set nowrapscan # debug off
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>3. Replacing uppercase or mixedcase <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tags with the more modern <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>:set wrapscan # debug on
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:set hlsearch # debug on
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:/&lt;BR&gt; # try 1.. hmm.. just uppercase.. not gonna work..
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:/&lt;br&gt; # try 2.. hmm.. just lowercase..
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:/&lt;BR&gt;/i # try 3.. ahh.. that&#39;ll be it then
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:%s/&lt;BR&gt;/&lt;br&gt;/gi # lets execute my regex substitution
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:/BR # check 1.. testing things are OK in my file by searching through..
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:/br # check 2.. yep thats ok..
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>/bR # check 3 ..yup..
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:/&lt;BR&gt;/i # check 4.. yep looks ok... the problem tags seem to be gone
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span># ...manual scroll through the document.. looks good!
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:w # write out to file
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>:set nohlsearch # debug off

      <description>A common task when setting up an Apache webserver under Linux, is writing a httpd.conf file. The httpd.conf file is the main configuration file for Apache. One of the main reasons to edit the httpd.conf file is to setup virtual hosts In Apache. A Virtual host configuration allows several different domains to be run off a single instance of Apache, on a single IP. Each host is a &amp;lsquo;Virtual host&amp;rsquo;, and typically has a different web root, log file, and any number of subdomains aliased to it.</description>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_server">Ubuntu</a>, virutalhosts are made easy. The httpd.conf is split into several files. Each virutalhost has a different file in <code>/etc/apache2/sites-available</code>. When you want to activate a particular vitualhost, you create a symbolic link from <code>/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/mysite</code> to <code>/etc/apache2/sites-available/mysite</code> (if you wanted to call your site configuration file &lsquo;mysite&rsquo;). When apache boots up, it loads all the files it can find in <code>/etc/apache2/sites-available/*</code> and that determines which virutalhosts it loads. If there is not a link from <code>/etc/apache2/sites-available/</code> to your virutalhost file, it won&rsquo;t load it. So you can easily remove the links in /etc/apache2/sites-available without deleting the actual virutalhost file. Therefore you can easily toggle which virtualhosts get loaded.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centos">CentOS</a> uses a different structure. Everything is lumped into <code>/etc/apache/httpd.conf</code>. So there is no way to easily toggle virutalhosts on/off, and everything is a bit more chaotic. I&rsquo;ve just had to setup a new CentOS webserver, and I struggled for a bit after being used to ubuntu-server. Here&rsquo;s a format you can use if you&rsquo;re in the same boat, and you have to setup httpd.conf files for CentOS:</p>

Apache will decide on which to choose based on the &lsquo;ServerName&rsquo; specified in each VirtualHost section. Just remember to add that all-important <code>NameVirtualHost: *:80</code> in the beginning.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got your httpd.conf file the way you like it, be sure to test it before you restart apache. If you restart apache and your httpd.conf file has errors in it, Apache will abort the load process. This means that all the websites on your webserver will fail to load. I always use <code>apachectl -t</code> or <code>apache2ctl -t</code> before I restart. That will parse the httpd.conf file and check the syntax. Once that&rsquo;s OK, then you can issue a <code>/etc/init.d/httpd restart</code> to restart Apache.</p>

      <title>MicroKORG &#43; Python = MIDI fun!</title>

      <description>So, about a month ago I got a second-hand microKORG from Ebay. Fiddling around with the preset patches, and creating new patches is great fun, even though I only know a few chords. Recently I plugged it in to my PC via my M-Audio Uno USB-&amp;gt;MIDI interface, and soon was using Ableton Live to program drums in time with the microKORG&amp;rsquo;s arp.
I thought I&amp;rsquo;d experiment the music libraries available in python, and see if I could send notes to the synth via MIDI.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, about a month ago I got a second-hand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroKORG">microKORG</a> from Ebay. Fiddling around with the preset patches, and creating new patches is great fun, even though I only know a few chords. Recently I plugged it in to my PC via my <a href="http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/product/1773-m-audio-uno-usb.html">M-Audio Uno USB-&gt;MIDI interface</a>, and soon was using Ableton Live to program drums in time with the microKORG&rsquo;s arp.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d experiment the music libraries available in python, and see if I could send notes to the synth via MIDI. Turns out that the M-Audio Uno is supported under Ubuntu, all you have to do is install the <code>midisport-firmware</code> package. With the help of <a href="http://trac2.assembla.com/pkaudio/wiki/pyrtmidi">pyrtmidi</a>, a set of python wrappers around the C++ audio library rtmidi I was able to recieve MIDI signals in realtime from the microKORG, and send them in realtime also. With the help of <a href="http://www.davidcraddock.net/images/midilib.py">this</a> old midi file reader/writer library that I found posted to a python mailing list, I&rsquo;ve made some progress in writing a simple MIDI file player that sends notes to the &lsquo;KORG.</p>

      <description>So, after saying all that stuff about how vimplugin and EasyEclipse was great, I actually started to use the setup heavily, and it started to annoy me.
For one, EE is not a recent build of eclipse, nor does it come with a full set of recent plugins. This makes it annoyingly difficult to use when you want to use more than the set of plugins it packages for you. As far as vimplugin goes, it does not provide the vim integration I thought it might from embedded vim.</description>

As far as vimplugin goes, it does not provide the vim integration I thought it might from embedded vim. Not really even close.</p>
<p>What I use now, after lots of trial and error, and at least 4 reinstalls of Eclipse, is a combination of Eclipse 3.4.2, <a href="http://eclim.sourceforge.net/">Eclim</a>, (which is the most mature of the free vi-binding plugins around, and actually includes an improved version of the vimplugin previously mentioned), and the latest pydev, Mylyn and Subeclipse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using it now to refactor a largeish python project, and I&rsquo;m really appreciating the help it gives me. Definitely worth trying an Eclipse setup similar to this if you&rsquo;re writing any python apps that are more than small-scale.</p>

      <description>Up until now, I&amp;rsquo;ve always used the terminal for programming development on my projects. Because I&amp;rsquo;m so familiar with the advanced text editor vim, I can get a lot done on the command line, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t detract away from what is actually going on behind the scenes, as a lot of IDEs seem to do.
However, in reading the book Foundations of Agile Python Development (which I recommend highly), and through working in software houses using IDE s only, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realise that I need to gain at least some familiarity with an IDE.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Up until now, I&rsquo;ve always used the terminal for programming development on my projects. Because I&rsquo;m so familiar with the advanced text editor <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a>, I can get a lot done on the command line, and it doesn&rsquo;t detract away from what is actually going on behind the scenes, as a lot of IDEs seem to do.</p>
<p>However, in reading the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Python-Development-Experts-Source/dp/1590599810">Foundations of Agile Python Development</a> (which I recommend highly), and through working in software houses using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> s only, I&rsquo;ve come to realise that I need to gain at least some familiarity with an IDE.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve decided to try out <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>. I fiddled around with the Eclipse version in the Ubuntu 8.10 repositories for a while, with little success. I wanted to install <a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.ne">pydev</a> and <a href="http://vimplugin.org/">vimplugin</a>. Pydev is an eclipse python development environment. Vimplugin allows vim keybindings, and can actually embed the gvim editor within Eclipse. I tried for a few hours, but couldn&rsquo;t get it all working with the stock Eclipse version in the Ubuntu repositories.</p>
<p>So I thought I&rsquo;d try out <a href="http://www.easyeclipse.org/site/distributions/python.html">EasyEclipse</a>. EasyEclipse bundles a stable version of Eclipse with pydev in its &ldquo;Easy Eclipse for Python Development&rdquo; distribution, and that worked a charm. I then installed vimplugin which worked immediately when enabled, and supported embedded VIM mode within Eclipse. In the screenshot below, you should be able to (just about!) see what I mean, gvim is embedded into Eclipse:</p>

      <description>I did something out of the ordinary this Christmas. I bought an &amp;ldquo;XO&amp;rdquo; laptop for a child in a third world country. I also bought an XO laptop for myself, so I can develop software designed to be distributed to the 1 million+ XO laptops out there in the third world.
The laptop runs a Linux operating system, with an special interface programmed almost exclusively in Python. Most apps, called &amp;lsquo;activities&amp;rsquo;, run as python programs.</description>

<p>The laptop runs a Linux operating system, with an special interface programmed almost exclusively in Python. Most apps, called &lsquo;activities&rsquo;, run as python programs. This is ideal for me, as I enjoy hacking around in python, and Linux is - of course - very familiar to me.</p>
<p>I hope to use the laptop to contribute to health informatics applications that allow the laptop to be used in hospitals where there are no existing comparable health systems. If you wish to get involved in this project and give something back, here in the UK you can now order your own laptop <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/One-Laptop-Per-Child-XO/dp/B001LDQWJI">from Amazon.co.uk</a>.</p>

      <description>This is so cool.. Google are beta-testing a totally free hosting and cloud-computing resource called Google App Engine. The caveat is that your hosted app must be written in Python. Python is amazing anyway, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t know it, now is the perfect time to learn. Check this out for more information about Google App Engine:

They&amp;rsquo;re giving away a very generous 500MB disk space and enough processing power to serve 5 million pages a month.</description>

      <description>Bacula is a great open-source distributed backup program for Linux/UNIX systems. It is separated into three main components:
One &amp;lsquo;Director&amp;rsquo; - which sends messages to the other components and co-ordinates the backup One or more &amp;lsquo;File Demons&amp;rsquo; - which &amp;lsquo;pull&amp;rsquo; the data from the host they are installed from. One or more &amp;lsquo;Storage Demons&amp;rsquo; - which &amp;lsquo;push&amp;rsquo; the data taken from the file demons into a type of archival storage, IE: backup tapes, a backup hard disc, etc I found it extremely versatile yet very complicated to configure.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bacula is a great open-source distributed backup program for Linux/UNIX systems. It is separated into three main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>One &lsquo;Director&rsquo; - which sends messages to the other components and co-ordinates the backup</li>
<li>One or more &lsquo;File Demons&rsquo; - which &lsquo;pull&rsquo; the data from the host they are installed from.</li>
<li>One or more &lsquo;Storage Demons&rsquo; - which &lsquo;push&rsquo; the data taken from the file demons into a type of archival storage, IE: backup tapes, a backup hard disc, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>I found it extremely versatile yet very complicated to configure. Before you configure it you have to decide on a backup strategy; what you want to backup, why you want to back it up, how often you want to back it up, and how you are going to off-site/preserve the backups.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t cover everything about Bacula here, so I thought I&rsquo;d concentrate on scheduling. You will need to understand quite a lot about the basics of Bacula before you&rsquo;ll be able to understand scheduling, so I recommend reading up on the basics first.</p>
<p>I had the most problems with the scheduling. In the end I chose to adopt this schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly Full backup, with a retention period of 6 months, and a maximum number of backup volumes of 6.</li>
<li>Weekly Differential backup against the monthly full backup, with a retention period of 1 month, and a maximum number of backup volumes of 4.</li>
<li>Daily Incremental backup against the differential backup, with a retention period of 2 weeks, and a maximum number of backup volumes of 14.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that there will always be 2 weeks of incremental backups to fall back on which depend on a weekly differential which depends on a monthly full. This strategy aims to save as much space as possible - there is no redundancy. This means that if a backup fails, especially a monthly or weekly, it will have to be re-run immediately.</p>
<p>The backup volumes will cycle using this method; they will be reused once the maxium volume limits are hit. Also, if you run a backup job from the console, it will revert to the &lsquo;Default&rsquo; pool, so you will have to explicitly define either the daily incremental, weekly differential or the monthly full pools.</p>
<p>Here is my director configuration:</p>

      <title>Linux under Hyper-V</title>

      <description>This is an overview of current Linux support under Hyper-V, the free Windows Server 2008 virtualisation product.
As you probably know, virtual servers allow the emulation of hardware in software. So you have a single physical &amp;lsquo;virtual server&amp;rsquo;. This virtual server emulates the physical hardware for several &amp;lsquo;virtual machines&amp;rsquo; which sit on top of the virtual server. As far as the operating system on the virtual machine is concerned, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t notice anything different at all - it thinks it is running on a full set of dedicated hardware.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an overview of current Linux support under Hyper-V, the free Windows Server 2008 virtualisation product.</p>
<p>As you probably know, virtual servers allow the emulation of hardware in software. So you have a single physical &lsquo;virtual server&rsquo;. This virtual server emulates the physical hardware for several &lsquo;virtual machines&rsquo; which sit on top of the virtual server. As far as the operating system on the virtual machine is concerned, it doesn&rsquo;t notice anything different at all - it thinks it is running on a full set of dedicated hardware. However in reality, the virtual server is sharing its real physical resouces amongst the collection of virtual machines, assigning for example - 3GB of its memory to virtual machine A, and 1GB to virtual machine B.</p>
<p>Hyper-V requires a package called the &lsquo;integration components&rsquo; to be installed on each virtual machine. This makes it easier for the virtual machine operating system kernel to talk with the virtual server, speeds up and increases the reliability of the emulation of virtual machine hardware by the virtual server.</p>
<p>Hyper-V supports the Xen virtualisation layer. Xen is a Linux-only virtualisation platform that requires a patched kernel on the virtual machine in order for the virtual server to communicate with the virtual machine.</p>
<p>The only officially supported distribution is SuSE Enterprise Linux 10, Service Packs 1 + 2. However because of the way the Hyper-V works, any Xen kernel in theory can be patched to run under Hyper-V.</p>
<p>In fact, this is exactly what you have to do in order to get any Linux distro fully working under the Hyper-V virtual server. So:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the kernel source for the Xen kernel for your distro</li>
<li>Patch it with the Hyper-V integration services patch</li>
<li>Compile the kernel</li>
</ol>
<p>.. and bingo - you should have Linux &lsquo;fully supported&rsquo; by Hyper-V.</p>
<p>Now it remains to be seen whether there are any problems with running Linux under Hyper-V in a live environment. I know that we encountered multiple problems with Linux under VMWare ESX Server - and VMWare is the most mature virtualisation product available.</p>
<p>Those problems included: network interfaces dropping packets and the virtual machine system clock &lsquo;drifting&rsquo; - running too fast or slow. These are NOT problems you want in a live enviroment, and so it remains to be seen whether Hyper-V can support Linux with the same ease as it supports Windows OSs.</p>

      <description>The Stanford engineering department, often regarded as the best in the world for computer science education, has made its core CS curriculum free for anyone with an internet connection. There are some catches, ie: you don&amp;rsquo;t get your assignments marked, you have no contact with the lecturer, but all the same, it is really a great resource. The material is very high-quality, professionally filmed lectures and a full compliment of handouts and course notes.</description>

The material is very high-quality, professionally filmed lectures and a full compliment of handouts and course notes. It also does not even assume knowledge of programming - it teaches you right from the basics.</p>

      <description>At work I&amp;rsquo;ve written a couple of scripts that send out emails to the appropriate project team when someone checks in a commit to the project subversion repository. Here are the details.
Firstly, you will need a subversion hook setup on post-commit. The post-commit hook needs to be located in SVNROOT/YOURPROJECT/hooks where YOURPROJECT is your svn project name, and SVNROOT is the root directory where you are storing the data files for your subversion repository.</description>

<p>Firstly, you will need a subversion hook setup on post-commit. The post-commit hook needs to be located in SVNROOT/YOURPROJECT/hooks where YOURPROJECT is your svn project name, and SVNROOT is the root directory where you are storing the data files for your subversion repository.</p>
<p>Substitute projectmember1,projectmember2 etc.. in the post-commit script below for the email addresses of the people to be notified when someone commits a change to the project.</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># this hook by invoking a program (script, executable, binary, etc.)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># named &#39;post-commit&#39; (for which this file is a template) with the</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># The default working directory for the invocation is undefined, so</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># the program should set one explicitly if it cares.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Because the commit has already completed and cannot be undone,</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># the exit code of the hook program is ignored.  The hook program</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># On a Unix system, the normal procedure is to have &#39;post-commit&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># invoke other programs to do the real work, though it may do the</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># work itself too.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Note that &#39;post-commit&#39; must be executable by the user(s) who will</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># have filesystem-level permission to access the repository.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># On a Windows system, you should name the hook program</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># &#39;post-commit.bat&#39; or &#39;post-commit.exe&#39;,</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># but the basic idea is the same.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># The hook program typically does not inherit the environment of</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># its parent process.  For example, a common problem is for the</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># PATH environment variable to not be set to its usual value, so</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># that subprograms fail to launch unless invoked via absolute path.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># If you&#39;re having unexpected problems with a hook program, the</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># culprit may be unusual (or missing) environment variables.</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Here is an example hook script, for a Unix /bin/sh interpreter.</span>

      <description>For some reason, under ubuntu-server, my default MySQL 5 character encoding was latin1. This caused no end of problems with grabbing data from the web, which was not necessarily in latin1 characterset.
If you are ever in this situation, I suggest you handle everything as UTF-8. That means setting the following lines in my.cnf:
[mysqld] .. default-character-set=utf8 skip-character-set-client-handshake If you already have tables in your database that you have created, and they have defaulted to the latin1 charset, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to tell by looking at the mysqldump SQL:</description>

<p>1. Dump the full database structure + data to a file using mysqldump
2. Substitute &rsquo;latin1&rsquo; for &lsquo;utf8&rsquo; universally on that file using your favourite text editor
3. Import the resultant file into mysql using the mysql -uroot -p -Dyourdb &lt; dump.sql method</p>
<p>Then everything will be in utf8, and your character encoding issues will be solved :)</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking away at BrightonSound.com and I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a way of automatically sourcing biographical information from artists, so that visitors are presented with more information on the event.
The Songbird media player plugin &amp;lsquo;mashTape&amp;rsquo; draws upon a number of web services to grab artist bio, event listings, youtube vidoes and flickr pictures of the currently playing artist. I was reading through the mashTape code, and then found this posting by its developer, which helpfully provided the exact method I needed.</description>

      <description>I passed the adExcellence exam first time.. woo! It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that difficult really.
&amp;ldquo;David Craddock of iCrossing is accredited as an official Microsoft adExcellence Member.

As of 21/3/08, I&amp;rsquo;m somehow also now #1 on Google.co.uk for the keyword &amp;ldquo;adExcellence exam&amp;rdquo;.. if that&amp;rsquo;s what you googled for, you probably want the adExcellence main site instead.</description>

      <description>I have just seen Yahoo! Pipes, and am convinced this is going to change the web. For real.
Data source sites will become &amp;lsquo;content providers&amp;rsquo;, data will be aggregated and filtered from multiple content providers, either by the user or by &amp;lsquo;intermediary&amp;rsquo; sites. The user will be able to choose his &amp;lsquo;data view&amp;rsquo; of the content on the internet, just as Google is currently doing.
This is fascinating stuff if you&amp;rsquo;re involved in the web industry.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s still developing, but it looks quite good, and we&amp;rsquo;re ready to start showing it off to people. So check it out!
UPDATE: This project is now defunct after running for several years, and is no longer hosted. But thanks for the interest!

      <description>I finally setup my Dell Lattitude D630 laptop the way I wanted it last night, and thought I&amp;rsquo;d do a quick writeup about it. Here is the parttition table:
A 40GB Windows XP partition, with VMWare Player installed, which I will be using for Windows applications that don&amp;rsquo;t play well in virtualised mode (eg media applications). I will also be using it as the main platform for running VMs. A basic 5GB root + 1.</description>

<li>A 40GB Windows XP partition, with VMWare Player installed, which I will be using for Windows applications that don&rsquo;t play well in virtualised mode (eg media applications). I will also be using it as the main platform for running VMs.</li>
<li>A basic 5GB root + 1.4GB swap 7.10 Ubuntu server partition, with VMWare Server installed (for creating, advanced editing and performing network testing on VMs). I used these <a href="http://x86virtualization.com/virtualizationnews/howto-install-vmware-server-on-ubuntu-710-part-1.html">VMWare server on Ubuntu 7.10</a> <a href="http://x86virtualization.com/virtualizationnews/howto-install-vmware-server-on-ubuntu-710-part-2.html">tutorials</a>.</li>
<li>A 36GB NTFS partition for storing VMs</li>
<li>A 26GB NTFS media partition for media I want to share between VMs and the two operating systems on the disc.</li>
</ol>
<p>We use VMWare servers at work to host our infrastructure, so this setup will be very useful for me. I can now:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take images off the servers at work and bring them up, edit them and test their network interactions under my local VMWare Server running on my Linux install.</li>
<li>From within my windows install, I can bring up a Linux VM and use Windows and Linux side by side.</li>

See: http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampBrighton2 and http://www.barcampbrighton.org/ for more info.
Update: Brighton Barcamp 2 is now over.
This was really interesting, and I learned a huge amount in a very short amount of time. Thanks to everyone who talked to me. I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be attending future Barcamps.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to learn a lot about search engines lately, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been starting at an internet marketing firm. I found this excellent list of online materials for university courses related to search engines:

In particular, these seem especially relevant:

      <description>I just noticed that US bulletinboard giant Craigslist.com has opened a Brighton UK section of their website! There are a few posts already. At the moment, Gumtree&amp;rsquo;s Brighton Section is massively popular here. I&amp;rsquo;ve recurited several flatmates using Gumtree, and am basing my local housing search around it.
It will be interesting to see how Gumtree.com fares now that Craigslist.com has competition in the Brighton local area.</description>

      <description>Nabaztag (Armenian for &amp;ldquo;rabbit&amp;rdquo;) is a Wi-Fi enabled rabbit, manufactured by Violet. The Nabaztag is a &amp;ldquo;smart object&amp;rdquo;; it can connect to the Internet (for example to download weather forecasts, read its owner&amp;rsquo;s email, etc). It is also fully customizable and programmable. - Wikipedia.org
Here is our Nabaztag - Francois Xavier:
Of course, I&amp;rsquo;ve been messing around with poor old Francois&amp;rsquo;s programming..
With the help of OpenNab, a proxy server that masquerades as an official Nabaztag server, you can make your Nabaztag do all kinds of tricks.</description>

<p>Here is our Nabaztag - Francois Xavier:</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;ve been messing around with poor old Francois&rsquo;s programming..</p>
<p>With the help of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opennab/">OpenNab</a>, a proxy server that masquerades as an official Nabaztag server, you can make your Nabaztag do all kinds of tricks. At the moment I&rsquo;m getting him to read out what&rsquo;s currently showing on TV when someone presses his button.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the technical details:</p>
<p>Whenever the button is pressed on Francois, he sends a message destined for the official Nabaztag server, that is caught by the proxy server. The proxy server then executes a PHP script. This PHP script grabs the current TV listings from a RSS feed, composes them into a readable list, and then sends the list to the official Nabaztag server, which converts the list (using a text-to-speech synthesis program) into audio files, and streams those audio files to Francois.</p>
<p>The result is a rabbit that reads the TV listings. A useful addition to our TV room.</p>
<p><strong>Coming soon:</strong> More technical information on how you can do this yourself.</p>

      <description>This blog will be about my perspective on technology. Anything that catches my interest will be fair game, but mainly it will revolve around internet technology and the development of such.
It will allow me to create an online presence, and to improve my writing skills.
I hope you will find the time to check back on this blog and watch it progress.</description>
