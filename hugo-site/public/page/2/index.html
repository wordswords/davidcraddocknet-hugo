    <p>I have been working from home, the majority of the time, for over 5 years. It took a lot of adjustment, and I’m still not 100% adjusted, but if you want to undertake this, then these are my tips.
Note that a big part of the benefit from working from home is the total flexibility in work environment, so these are only tips that work for me - they might not work for you! However, I think there is probably quite a bit of commonality.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>For years, UK politics has become more right-wing, popularist, and presidential.
Right-wing, because the Conservatives have been in power for over 10 years, and have had the opportunity to implement most of their ideological policies, which we see at the moment highlighted to an extreme with Liz Truss gearing up to emulate Thatcher on almost every level.
Popularist, because the Conservatives have implemented policies designed to appease the populations feelings, rather than those based on factual positive outcomes.

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Here are some extra tips if you’re just getting started out on Ubuntu.
You don’t have to go through the UI to shut down or reboot your computer. You can do it from the command line. The commands are:
sudo reboot # to reboot sudo poweroff # to shut down and power off the computer You can get a lot more information on your computers startup and shutdown sequences by removing the default Ubuntu splash screen that obscures this. You should definitely do this if you want to learn more about what your system is actually doing under the hood, especially if you need to troubleshoot what it’s doing. To do this:

    <p>For 8 TB of data storage on Google Drive, plus my own Google organization, I am paying £30/month, which is a pretty good deal.
I wanted to use this space for backing up my NAS, but it was proving difficult. The program I was recommended for Linux backup, Duplicati, was not the best for this purpose. My backup runs would not complete, they would be slow, and full of syncing errors.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I had planned a different network toplogy for sure, but this is my current setup and it seems to work well:
I was not able to implement connection load balancing using the Miktrotik router. It was just too complicated and didn’t work reliably enough. My current network is a gigabit network across all areas, so every PC has gigabit cables, switch and so on. I either have plugged in my Virgin Media 1000mb/50mbs internet connection or my BRSK fibre 900mb/900mb connection. I simply plug in the WAN cable from the main Linksys router into one of the hubs at one time. If one connection goes down, I manually switch over. I have a 10GB/sec SFP link between my server upstairs in the study and my main studio PC downstairs. This allows me to transfer files at 10Gb/sec rate between the two. I need two wireless repeaters, even though I have a small house, because the house walls are made of a concrete mix. This means the wireless signal needs boosting a lot. In the future, I may try load balancing again, or wait until one of my service providers offers &gt;1000mb/sec speeds. When this happens it would make sense to expand the 10Gbs/sec links as there would be more point. </p>

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I have nearly 20 years experience, so my skill-set is in high demand from all sorts of different organisations. If I were looking for a job, then these would be my priorities:
Understanding of medical appointments - My situation is that I currently have cancer. Although it’s recommended I work, some of my time will be spent in medical appointments at the hospital that is 15 mins walk away from me. Currently this is expected to take up 1 weekday every fortnight. 100% working from home - This means that, several years down the line, the company policy will NOT change to ’everyone in the office’. Almost all meetings should be remote-first, meaning that everyone is an equal participant in them if they are working remotely. Some people can of course dial in from an office location but they should be at no communication advantage compared to remote workers. Also, the main communication for the team and organisation should be done online, remote workers should not be ‘second class citizens’ to water-cooler gossip. No Java technology stack - This means that Java and IntelliJ are not used as the mainstay of the application stack. I do not like working with Java and find it convoluted. No unethical industries - This means no gambling, no defence, no industries which disadvantage society in a big way in general. Good Pension - An above-average pension contribution. I would expect to be seeing at least 6% max employer contribution which is double the NEST minimum. Good Pay - This is negotiable but I need to pay my bills, and that includes the 10% inflationary cost of living crisis we’re in. Ability to use my own development environment - My customised development environment will run without issue on Linux machines, OSX machines, and on Windows 11 with WSL2. I am SO much more productive and happy using it. Learning and dev time or budget allocated (nice to have) - This is a ’nice to have’ but really if you aren’t able and willing to expense costs such as monthly technical books (£50/month) maybe you should be asking yourself why not, as an organisation. </p>

    <p>I really like my Withings Mattress-Based Sleep Tracker.
I keep unusual sleeping hours a lot of the time, as I’m undergoing treatment, and a lot of the medication I’m taking effect my sleep. Even when I’m relatively healthy, some of the medication I’m on for a long-term condition also affects my sleep.
What’s more, I enjoy a non-standard sleeping schedule. I find I get more work done in the early morning or late at night. As I work from home 100% this is not as problematic as it used to be.

    <p>I have a relatively obscure hobby - I collect digital video games. Quite a few people collect physical games, but I like the advantages of having a large library of gaming options which are just a download away.
Like a lot of collectors, I have more games than I have actually played, or probably will do in my lifetime. I mostly get them via discounted bundles such as HumbleBundle.com, so I rarely play full price for them.
