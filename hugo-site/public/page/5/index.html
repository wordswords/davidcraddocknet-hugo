Start programming on personal projects right away, and keep it up during your entire working career. Always have something going on in the background. Get into a RUSSELL GROUP university in the UK and take a technical, demanding degree in a computing-related discipline, for example, Physics, Electronic Engineering, Maths, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence. If you can’t get into a university and course that isn’t in the top 25% of courses for your subject in the UK, and someone isn’t paying all your bills (e.g rich parents), don’t bother going to university, It’s not worth the loan. Find another way. Look into apprenticeships. Try to not be a total ’tech head’ and develop some creative and artistic side to you, taking up writing is a really good idea as it improves your thinking and communication skills. Ideally learn to write humanities essays to the standard of the first year humanities majors at your university. Try and get onto as many technical internships and technical work experience as possible throughout your degree. Once you have graduated, and found that the Junior tech worker job market is depressingly non-existant, move back in with your parents and start your informal and free ‘post-graduate’ learning. Take AT LEAST this free course but also certifications such as AWS certs, and anything that you have researched on Reddit etc that you can do cheaply and is sought after by your chosen target job (as evidenced by being mentioned on job descriptions of jobs you’d like to apply for). Increase your work on your personal projects and move to open source them and build up a following from them, and possibly a side-income. Keep in contact with your old uni friends, especially the ones that have got jobs. Read ‘So Good They Can’t Ignore You’ by Cal Newport, learn to market yourself, build your LinkedIn presence, network like crazy, and hopefully you will get your foot in the door with that ‘all important’ first job that you can launch a career off of. You’ll certainly deserve it.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-04-23 22:54:59 +0000 +0000'>April 23, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;David Craddock</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Advice to young people in the UK wanting a career in Tech" href=https://davidcraddock.net/2024/04/23/4683/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Music Acquisition Process for DJ Music</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>My music acquisition process for DJ music:
ARM (Automatic Ripping Machine) rips CDs I buy into FLAC form without any interactivity. You just insert a CD into the Linux server, and then it ejects it when it’s done. Lidarr downloads FLACs of any tracks of artists I have in my collection, but I don’t have their full discography. It does this automatically and silently in the background. Once a day, a cron job imports ARM and Lidarr downloads into my Beets.io music library, and deals with file integrity checks, tagging, metadata, library file structure and embedded images of the artist. Whenever I’m ready to have a fresh library copy, I run my batch script on my W11 DJ laptop and it robocopy mirrors the entire library from my Linux samba share onto my computer. I then send it through MixedInKey 10 to analyse the BPM and the music key of each track, and to check again the integrity of each file. Once that is done, and any corrupt files removed, I import the file library into Serato DJ Pro, and analyse the entire collection. This again removes any dud files from the collection. Now I have a complete music library, I run a batch file to reverse mirror the music from the DJ library back onto the server, so my collection doesn’t accumalate corrupt files. Now I have a full DJ music library of FLACs on my DJ laptop, over 22,000 files, great for requests!</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-01-11 23:41:50 +0000 GMT'>January 11, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;David Craddock</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Music Acquisition Process for DJ Music" href=https://davidcraddock.net/2024/01/11/music-acquisition-process-for-dj-music/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Retrospective for 2023</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Every year towards the end of the year, I put together a retrospective of events that have happened over the year - the good, bad and the ugly.
The Bad Most of the year was taken up with treatment for relapsed Hodgkins Lymphoma cancer. After the clinical immunotherapy drug trial finished in Feb 2023, cancer was unfortunately still detected, so it did not completely cure it. I had a further (awful) spell in hospital around March/April where my Hickman line became infected and I had a severe mental health episode, probably caused by the strong antibiotics being pumped through my system. Finally I was accepted for a stem cell transplant, and had my transplant on 4th July. We have had to deal with complications of cancer elsewhere in the family, not just my mum’s own cancer treatment being ongoing, but the financial impact of the family having to support both of us, is quite a significant burden. The Good Thankfully, I’m finally in remission for cancer! I have been in remission for 6 months, and if I make it to 2 years, then I am effectively cured. I have a 75% chance of it not coming back within that time, approximately. We got an absolute ton of stuff done on the house, and I have an awesome gaming setup, an awesome DJing setup, an awesome music production setup, an awesome high speed network and server setup, and an awesome WFH setup. All of the goals I set myself of things I wanted to achieve during my downtime having cancer treatment nearly 2 years ago, are more or less finished now. We have decided that we’re moving out of Manchester. We are going to move to Chester, which promises a much, much nicer, quieter, and actually, cheaper place to live now that I am committed to a 100% WFH work life. Things are progressing well with the house sale, and we’ve got a lot of interest so far. I have got fitter and healthier and my posture has got better over the year. I have also managed to reduce the medication I am on, which has helped my health. The Ugly There has been a worldwide downturn for software jobs, just as I had to take some time off my career due to work reasons. This downturn is probably comparable to the 2008/9 downturn in software jobs around the financial crisis. This is definitely bad news for everyone in software. ...</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2023-11-25 20:07:59 +0000 GMT'>November 25, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;David Craddock</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Retrospective for 2023" href=https://davidcraddock.net/2023/11/25/retrospective-for-2023/></a></article><footer class=page-footer><nav class=pagination><a class=prev href=https://davidcraddock.net/page/4/>«&nbsp;Prev&nbsp;4/40
