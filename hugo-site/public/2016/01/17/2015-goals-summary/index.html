  <div class="post-content"><p>At the start of 2015, I wrote down <a href="http://www.davidcraddock.net/2015/01/17/goals-for-the-year-2015/">some goals for 2015</a>. Around half-way through the year, I revisited these goals with <a href="http://www.davidcraddock.net/2015/09/01/goals-for-the-year-2015-midway-update/">some thoughts on how well I&rsquo;d done</a>. Now 2015 is over, I want to reflect on what has been achieved and what hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I also want to comment on the fact that I am discussing personal things here. A few years ago I was decided that I was going to keep this blog professional and pretty much dry of any thoughts or feelings on my personal life. I have moved away from that though, inspired by blogs such as <a href="http://www.cubicgarden.com">Iain&rsquo;s</a>, where personal thoughts and feelings are mixed with technical observations. I would like to think that this isn&rsquo;t a bad move; after all if potential employers come to look at this 5 years from now, and don&rsquo;t like what I&rsquo;ve done here, then I probably don&rsquo;t want to work for them anyway. There is the argument that blogs should be &rsquo;themed&rsquo; or targetted towards a particular subject to garner followers, and that too much sharing is possibly a bad thing. However, my current thoughts are that dry techncial info is boring, and I&rsquo;d rather mix it with other things that are important to me.</p>

<p>With that said.. 2015 was an eventful year, some things were awesome, some not.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Not Awesome&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mum started treatment for cancer, which is a non-curable kind, Myeloma. The treatment was a success and she is currently in remission for the time being, so that is a good thing, but how long she will stay in remission we do not know. Both my remaining grandparents also sadly passed away. I also split up with my girlfriend of 5 years, which was difficult and still haunts me to a certain degree.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Awesome&rdquo;</p>
<p>The money that my parents were going to put towards the wedding of the ex-girlfriend, they gave to me so I could put a deposit down on a house. So in August I bought and moved into a house in Withington, which I am in the process of doing up. It is <em>incredibly</em> cheap to buy in Manchester compared to the south-east of England, where I&rsquo;m originally from, where the dream of having my own 3 bed, semi-detached house would not be possible in any area with a reasonable number of IT jobs in short distance. I don&rsquo;t drive, so the fact that the tram stop is 10 minutes walk away is great for getting to work.</p>
<p>I met my current girlfriend, Conny in May, and things seem to be going very well; she is even planning to move from Berlin to Manchester to live with me. This is obviously great, and I don&rsquo;t know where I would be without her support.</p>
<p>Work</p>
<p>With all these things happening in my personal life, work took a secondary focus as I got things sorted. It also made me rethink what I wanted from my career. At the start of 2015 I had a new role, as Test Manager; the first level of technical management in my area at the BBC, and a big career move for me. Although I liked some aspects of the management role, I missed the technical challenges that had pretty much characterised the last 10 years of my career. There was not much direct coding, and I felt I was in danger of losing that aspect of my work. I took a 6 month attachment to R&amp;D, which had me working in an extremely challenging technical role, on a HTML5 360 VR engine. In April when this attachment ends, I am looking to continue in a technical role of some description, and not return to pure management, at least for the meantime.</p>
<h3 id="goals-of-2015---how-did-i-do">Goals of 2015 - How Did I Do?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#goals-of-2015---how-did-i-do">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Work Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Settle into my new role at the BBC as Test Manager</em> - As I mentioned before I&rsquo;ve taken a move towards another route in my career</li>
<li><em>Pushing for a place to be opened up in Platform Test to employ someone from the Extend Scheme</em> - This was achieved, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bmustillrose">Ben</a> has joined the BBC on an Extend placement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Creative Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Get better at music production</em> - This has been achieved. I worked with my friend Gio, who taught me quite a few tricks about Ableton. I have <a href="http://cachebuster.bandcamp.com/releases">released a 3-track EP called &lsquo;Planetary Orbital&rsquo; on Bandcamp</a>. I am also <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Synth-and-Electronic-Music-Production-Group/">helping to organise a Music Production Meetup.com in Manchester</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Getting married</em> - Nope. Maybe later.</li>
<li><em>Making friends with more people that share the same interests</em> - Partly achieved. The Meetup groups will help this. I have also helped start a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/VRManchester">&lsquo;Virtual Reality Manchester&rsquo; Meetup group, for VR fans in Manchester</a>, the first meetup is next month.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Financial Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Saving more over the course of the year</em> - Partly achieved. I have bought a house, so now I am in a quite a bit of debt, but the money I will be putting towards my mortgage will be money I am effectively &lsquo;saving&rsquo; because it will be put into the value of the house.</li>
<li><em>Joining a pension scheme</em> - Achieved.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Health Goals</strong></p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<p>ul&gt;
<em>Adopt a regular form of keeping fit</em> - Partly achieved. I have now setup a return commute which involves walking past a gym that I&rsquo;m a member of, so it is quite easy to go in there for 30 mins on the treadmill 2-3 times a week. I&rsquo;ve just got to maintain the discipline.</p>
