      <description>I found this awesome cut-up poetry generator, which takes the text of famous poets and builds structured poetry out of it. The guy that made it even developed the underlying algorithm as a research project. I have put a version of a free Amazon EC2 instance, wrote a little twitter bot in node.js, and wired the poetry generator with the twitter bot, and now I have this: https://twitter.com/haikumachine - a twitter bot that posts a haiku every five minutes, derived from Dylan Thomas&amp;rsquo;s poetry.</description>

<p>It could be improved, and there are sometimes erroneous tweets where the syllables aren&rsquo;t counted quite right, or some of the punctuation doesn&rsquo;t make sense once cut up, but damnit, it&rsquo;s a bot that writes Haikus.</p>
