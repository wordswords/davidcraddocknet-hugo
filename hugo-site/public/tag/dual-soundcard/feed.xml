      <title>Audio Routing for my PC</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my own benefit as much as anyone elses, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d document my PC audio setup. I have two soundcards and two sets of speakers, one surround soundcard and speaker set for gaming and watching surround sound movies, and one audio interface linked up to my studio monitor speakers for music production. I also have a Digi 002 mixer which I use to mix in the outputs from my synthesisers to my recording interface. When I want to record, I usually record one track at a time from a synthesier to the audio input of the audio interface, via the Digi 002 mixer:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have two soundcards - maybe a normal soundcard for your speakers and maybe a headset with its own audio interface - you will want some way of switching all audio between the two. This is an great little open-source tool to do just that. It works on Mac, and Windows 7 up to 10:&lt;/p&gt;
