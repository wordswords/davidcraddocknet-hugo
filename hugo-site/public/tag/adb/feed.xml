      <description>I wanted to get a Kindlefire HDX running under Ubuntu 12.04 with adb.
First I needed to setup the udev rules:
1. Edit /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules as root, and add the following line (create this file if it does not exist):
SUBSYSTEM==&amp;#34;usb&amp;#34;, ATTRS{idVendor}==&amp;#34;1949&amp;#34;, MODE=&amp;#34;0666&amp;#34; 2. Change the permission of this file by executing the following command as root:
chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules 3. Reload the rules by executing the following command as root:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a project at the BBC where we are using the Android command-line tools from the Android Developer Tools, to spin up and terminate series of emulators. I noticed a big problem under OSX where &amp;lsquo;adb devices&amp;rsquo; was failing to register emulators occasionally when we started them up, without any error message, even though they were loaded and quite clearly running in a window on OSX. This was a real problem for our project because we needed absolute parity between emulator process being launched and subsequently being detected by adb.</description>
