      <description>Using Jenkinsfiles in repositories for declarative pipelines, which is an example as infrastructure as code, is absolutely the right thing to do, in my opinion.&#xA;However the tooling for debugging and error checking Jenkinsfiles is currently quite difficult.&#xA;Setup Jenkinsfile linter First of all you need to make sure to be able to access the Jenkinsfile linter. This linter is processed on the Jenkins server itself, unusually. There is a configuration option that requires adminstrator access to the Jenkins server.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just recently bought a Macbook Pro for myself, after having used a MBP at work for 4 years. I find it to be a really powerful development environment for the development I do, in languages such as Java, PHP, Ruby, Python and JS. Here is what I use day-to-day:&#xA;OSX El Capitan I haven&amp;rsquo;t found anything not to like about this upgrade. I don&amp;rsquo;t use a lot of external devices, for which Bruce has found problems with El Capitan&amp;rsquo;s new restricted driver management for Arduinos and others.</description>

      <title>256 Color VIM on Crunchbang Waldorf</title>

      <description>To get 256 colors working within terminator in Crunchbang Waldorf, I had to do the following:&#xA;Add to ~/.bashrc&#xA;export TERM=xterm-256color Install a 256 color VIM colorcheme, see desert256 for example.&#xA;Add the following to ~/.vimrc:&#xA;set t_Co=256 set t_AB=^[[48;5;%dm set t_AF=^[[38;5;%dm &amp;rsquo;t_Co&amp;rsquo; specifies exactly how many colours VIM can use. The other two lines seem to be Debian-specific color code escape sequences.&#xA;If you want 256 color VIM for your root user when you sudo edit, then edit /usr/share/vim/vimrc and copy across your settings from your local ~/.</description>

      <title>My minimal VIM config</title>
      <link>http://davidcraddock.net:9796/2010/03/18/my-minimal-vim-config/</link>

      <description>This is the absolute minimum I do when I have to log onto a new server or shell account that I haven&amp;rsquo;t used before, that I will need to edit text files with.&#xA;First I figure out whether VIM is really installed. A lot of installs, especially those based on ubuntu, ship with VI aliased to VIM, but the VIM install is usually not really VIM at all, and behaves exactly like VI but with some minor bugs fixed.</description>

      <title>Eclipse 3.4.2 &#43; Pydev &#43; Eclim = win</title>

      <description>So, after saying all that stuff about how vimplugin and EasyEclipse was great, I actually started to use the setup heavily, and it started to annoy me.&#xA;For one, EE is not a recent build of eclipse, nor does it come with a full set of recent plugins. This makes it annoyingly difficult to use when you want to use more than the set of plugins it packages for you. As far as vimplugin goes, it does not provide the vim integration I thought it might from embedded vim.</description>
