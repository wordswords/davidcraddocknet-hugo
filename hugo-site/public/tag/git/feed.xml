      <description>A few months ago I switched across from Bash onto the Fish shell, on my main development machine. I can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of its fast autosuggestions and its sane scripting language. Compared to Bash it is very fun to use.&#xA;Today I wrote a script to automate the backup of my development workspace onto a private bitbucket account. Bitbucket is good because it allows unlimited private repositories, but it caps the size of these repos at 2GB max, with some features disabled after 1GB.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just recently bought a Macbook Pro for myself, after having used a MBP at work for 4 years. I find it to be a really powerful development environment for the development I do, in languages such as Java, PHP, Ruby, Python and JS. Here is what I use day-to-day:&#xA;OSX El Capitan I haven&amp;rsquo;t found anything not to like about this upgrade. I don&amp;rsquo;t use a lot of external devices, for which Bruce has found problems with El Capitan&amp;rsquo;s new restricted driver management for Arduinos and others.</description>
