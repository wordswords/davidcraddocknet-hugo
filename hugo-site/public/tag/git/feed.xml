&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I switched across from Bash onto the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fishshell.com/&#34;&gt;Fish shell&lt;/a&gt;, on my main development machine. I can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of its fast autosuggestions and its sane scripting language. Compared to Bash it is very fun to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I wrote a script to automate the backup of my development workspace onto a private bitbucket account. Bitbucket is good because it allows unlimited private repositories, but it caps the size of these repos at 2GB max, with some features disabled after 1GB. This means that I want to find out the size of my repo before automatically backing it up. This script does this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just recently bought a Macbook Pro for myself, after having used a MBP at work for 4 years. I find it to be a really powerful development environment for the development I do, in languages such as Java, PHP, Ruby, Python and JS. Here is what I use day-to-day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;osx-el-capitan&#34;&gt;OSX El Capitan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t found anything not to like about this upgrade. I don&amp;rsquo;t use a lot of external devices, for which &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/custardcat&#34;&gt;Bruce&lt;/a&gt; has found problems with El Capitan&amp;rsquo;s new restricted driver management for Arduinos and others. I like the fact I can use split screen functionality to side-by-side two windows easily, a feature that I very much like in Windows 10 too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
