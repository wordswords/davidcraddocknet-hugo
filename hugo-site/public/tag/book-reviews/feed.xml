      <description>The classic!&#xA;Yes! Some people actually write and read BOOKS on DJing. As if YouTube wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough. Well it can be enough.. but YouTube is also a cess pit of rubbish information, and at least a book has a better chance of being properly edited and reviewed. Also reading a book makes you more intellectual. Which is utterly true.&#xA;So. I have been reading through these DJing books to see if they could teach me something I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about DJing after over 10 years doing it.</description>
