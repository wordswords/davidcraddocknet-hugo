      <description>A few months ago I switched across from Bash onto the Fish shell, on my main development machine. I can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of its fast autosuggestions and its sane scripting language. Compared to Bash it is very fun to use.&#xA;Today I wrote a script to automate the backup of my development workspace onto a private bitbucket account. Bitbucket is good because it allows unlimited private repositories, but it caps the size of these repos at 2GB max, with some features disabled after 1GB.</description>

      <description>Linux command-line editors such as nano and vim often, by default, create backup files with the prefix of &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;. I.e, if I created a file called /home/david/myfile, then nano would create a backup in /home/david/myfile. Sometimes it doesn&amp;rsquo;t delete them either, so you&amp;rsquo;re left with a bunch of backup files all over the place, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re editing a lot on a directory tree full of source code.&#xA;Those stray backup files make directory listings confusing, and also add unnecessary weight to the commits on source control systems such as svn, cvs, git.</description>
