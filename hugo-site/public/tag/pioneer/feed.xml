      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidcraddock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dj-controller.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://davidcraddock.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dj-controller.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dj controller&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to buy the DDJ-SR controller because it was cheaper than even the cheapest pair of Pioneer CDJs. I’m no stranger to using a laptop and controller, before the DDJ-SR I used my trusty Faderfox DJ2 controller, which is a basic no-frills ‘play buttons, 3 EQs, crossfader and volume faders’ unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was considering getting the Native Instruments Traktor S4 DJ controller, which is one of the most popular full-size controllers for Traktor. However, after borrowing one from a friend, I compared the build quality of the DDJ-SR versus the S4, and there was no contest! The Pioneer DDJ-SR has the same buttons and jog wheel as the Pioneer CDJ units, which are rock solid and industry standard. For anyone wanting to use CDJs in the club after using the DDJ-SR at home, you will find the feel very familiar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
