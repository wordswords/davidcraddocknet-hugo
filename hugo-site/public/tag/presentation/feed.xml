      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, myself and two colleagues from the BBC, ran a session on Test Driven Development at the Manchester University &amp;lsquo;Ultimate Programming&amp;rsquo; society. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.man-up.appspot.com/&#34;&gt;The society&lt;/a&gt; is a gathering where students discuss cool things they have done with programming, and occasionally have guest speakers from industry. I found the society online and thought it would be great to get the BBC more involved in the local university happenings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the first outreach project that I have undertaken, and it required a lot of preparation. Our initial idea was to get students to implement the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm&#34;&gt;A* search algorithm&lt;/a&gt; in a practical session, using TDD. However after we had all implemented our own copy of the algorithm, and realised it had taken several hours each, we realised we&amp;rsquo;d not have enough time in the 2 hour slot that we had.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
