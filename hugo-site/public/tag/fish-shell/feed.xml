      <description>These functions are quite handy, and allow you to do things such as copy and paste errors and google for them without having to manually open a browser. You have to enclose arguments to both functions in single quotes, e.g. &amp;lsquo;chrome &amp;lsquo;http://www.google.co.uk&amp;rsquo; and google &amp;lsquo;one two three four&amp;rsquo;. You should add these to your config file at ~/.config/fish/config.fish and make sure Google Chrome is already installed.
[code language=&amp;ldquo;bash&amp;rdquo;] function chrome /usr/bin/open -a &amp;lsquo;/Applications/Google Chrome.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I switched across from Bash onto the Fish shell, on my main development machine. I can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of its fast autosuggestions and its sane scripting language. Compared to Bash it is very fun to use.
Today I wrote a script to automate the backup of my development workspace onto a private bitbucket account. Bitbucket is good because it allows unlimited private repositories, but it caps the size of these repos at 2GB max, with some features disabled after 1GB.</description>
