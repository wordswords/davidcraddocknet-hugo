      <description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a concise guide to setting this up quickly so thought it was worth a post. To quickly get something working and create a https server using the above versions of openssl and node.js, do the following:
Generate self-signed server certificate with no password sudo openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ./csr.pem -out server.crt -days 3001 -nodes Use this node.js code to setup a server quickly const https = require(&#39;https&#39;); const fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;); const options = { key: fs.</description>

      <description>I found this awesome cut-up poetry generator, which takes the text of famous poets and builds structured poetry out of it. The guy that made it even developed the underlying algorithm as a research project. I have put a version of a free Amazon EC2 instance, wrote a little twitter bot in node.js, and wired the poetry generator with the twitter bot, and now I have this: https://twitter.com/haikumachine - a twitter bot that posts a haiku every five minutes, derived from Dylan Thomas&amp;rsquo;s poetry.</description>

<p>It could be improved, and there are sometimes erroneous tweets where the syllables aren&rsquo;t counted quite right, or some of the punctuation doesn&rsquo;t make sense once cut up, but damnit, it&rsquo;s a bot that writes Haikus.</p>
