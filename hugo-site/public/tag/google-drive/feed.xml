      <description>For 8 TB of data storage on Google Drive, plus my own Google organization, I am paying £30/month, which is a pretty good deal.
I wanted to use this space for backing up my NAS, but it was proving difficult. The program I was recommended for Linux backup, Duplicati, was not the best for this purpose. My backup runs would not complete, they would be slow, and full of syncing errors.</description>

<p>I wanted to use this space for backing up my NAS, but it was proving difficult. The program I was recommended for Linux backup, Duplicati, was not the best for this purpose. My backup runs would not complete, they would be slow, and full of syncing errors.</p>
<p>Until I discovered rclone.</p>
<p>rclone was much better than Duplicati at backing up my NAS to Google Drive.</p>
<p>This is the script I use to sync the NAS content to Google Drive: <a href="https://github.com/wordswords/dotfiles/blob/568a8768154de8609a01b26560373ec5ca0eab85/bin/rclone-backup.sh">https://github.com/wordswords/dotfiles/blob/568a8768154de8609a01b26560373ec5ca0eab85/bin/rclone-backup.sh</a></p>
<p>It works just like rsync, but with a progress indicator. I&rsquo;ve added it to my crontab and it syncs everything up weekly.</p>
